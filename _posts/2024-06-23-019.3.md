##### [WARREN IS PACING UP AND DOWN THE QUARANTINE SUITE EATING GRUEL ANXIOUSLY FROM A PLASTIC BOWL WHILE A RECORDING OF GORDON PLAYS]

#### GORDON

_[animatedly, no longer meticulously scripted]_ ... it's all hidden in plain sight. It's not even hidden! Everyone's heard about the guy who got pushed off the top floor of the Overhead office in Düsseldorf. Everyone knows about the woman from Applied Sciences who boarded a flight to Hong Kong and never got off at the other end. And we all know about the guy who received his P45 from the Bio Science lab and then his flat burned down 3 days later while he was sleeping. This isn't swept under the carpet. We all know. This is lore. Look… Let me find the notes I took when I spoke to - hang on -

##### [GORDON SCRAMBLES THROUGH PAPERS, KNOCKING A DRINK OVER AND CURSING]

#### WARREN

_[confused]_ What are you talking about?... I don't get this. I don't get what's happening here.

#### GORD

How do you mean?

#### WARREN

Right, stop, stop, stop.

##### [GORD PAUSES THE RECORDING]

#### GORD

Are you alright, Warren?

#### WARREN

I don't understand.

#### GORD

Would you like to take a break and finish your breakfast? -

#### WARREN

An hour of sombre silence sitting in the rain getting stood up by his buddy and we then smash cut to full rabbit hole red-strings-on the-cork-board Gordon. Something's missing. What’s happened to Oscar?

##### [PAUSE]

#### GORD

Is that rhetorical or would you like…-

#### WARREN

I mean we can imagine what happened to Oscar, this is Red Valley. Something bad. But we have the inside track, don’t we? Gordon doesn't know that. So, what happened to Oscar?

##### [NO ANSWER]

#### WARREN

Not rhetorical.

#### GORD

Oh. We don't know.

#### WARREN

Don't worry about spoilers if it’s later on, you can just tell me now.

#### GORD

He's never referred to again. This is the next chapter.

##### [WARREN FINALLY STOPS MOVING]

#### WARREN

This is the next chapter? Are there, like, timestamps on this, how much time has passed?

#### GORD

These recordings are taken from cassette tape. There are no timestamps.

##### [WARREN IS THINKING]

#### WARREN

He cares very much about presentation.

#### GORD

I'm sorry?

##### [HE STARTS PACING AGAIN]

#### WARREN

No worries. What's next?

#### GORD

Would you like to take a break and finish your breakfast?

#### WARREN

No, I don't need to - I can do two things at once -

#### GORD

Okay.

##### [WARREN SWALLOWS HIS MOUTHFUL]

#### WARREN

What even is this stuff by the way? And the guy that dropped it off, he just said hi and disappeared. Like what was that?

#### GORD

That's a young man called Marm-

#### WARREN

Forget it. Forget it. Next.

#### GORD

Right.

##### [GORD SKIPS TO THE NEXT CHAPTER]
##### [AT THIS POINT GORDON HAS LOST ALL OF THE PRESENTATION SKILLS HE WAS HONING IN HIS INTRODUCTION - IT'S PURE STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS]

#### GORDON

So, you don't even need to look that far to find other people like me. Well not like me, but you know what I mean. I found the places online where they gather, where they talk. All Overhead. From all around the world. Sharing their theories, their fears. They think it's fun. Finding out the next terrible thing that happened in this place. They're a gang. They call themselves the Headlice.

#### WARREN

_[mouth full]_ Fuck Sake! What? Ugh.

#### GORDON

I've spoken to plenty of them. Earned my credentials. Caused quite a stir, turns out I'm not the only one who thinks bad things are going down at Red Valley. They joked about it. Just the latest canaries down the coal mine, they said. I keep them sweet, to know what they know. But I will never be one of them. I am no Headlouse. You want to stay ahead in this company, you better do it alone.

##### [WARREN'S ANXIETY IS GROWING]

#### WARREN

No.

#### GORDON

The latest theory is just bananas. Cryogenics. Human cryogenics, or cryonics, or whatever it's called!

#### WARREN

_[upset]_ Oh man… No! Next!

#### GORD

Okay.

##### [GORD SKIPS]
##### [WARREN AGITATION CAN BE HEARD CLEARLY AS, PARALLEL, GORDON SOUNDS EXCITED, FEVERISH]

#### GORDON

I have just been shown the most gnarly thing I have ever seen. I've been hassling the guy with the Demolition Man username for proof, and they finally sent me this. It’s video of an actual catastrophic triple point cryonic event taken at Red Valley! Triple point is when temperature and pressure combine to create simultaneous solid, liquid and vapour. Basically, freezing and boiling at the same time! And I just saw that happen with a fucking person in the middle of it. This guy was in a block of ice and then in an instant he was just... alphabetti spaghetti, he was slime! Oh God… I feel sick. But like... in a good way. I think this source is the real deal. Someone actually inside the cryonic project. Someone who actually worked with Bryony fucking Halbech -

#### WARREN

Fuck sake! What? Listen to yourself… No, no, no, no. NO! Fuck!

##### [WARREN THROWS HIS BOWL AND SPOON WHICH CLATTERS AGAINST THE WALL
##### [GORD STOPS THE RECORDING]

#### GORD

Would you like to talk about it, Warren?

##### [WARREN LAUGHS HOLLOWLY]

#### WARREN

_[freaked out]_ I don't fucking know what you are man. You don't even sound like him. And that doesn't sound like him. Not the Gordon that I know.

##### [PAUSE]

#### WARREN

I mean. Yeah. When I met him, he was sat at his desk in Archives, and... yeah. Fine. He was, wasn't he? He was just like that, I thought he was a nutjob. But tha… that's when I was... I wasn't really me, not really... Oh… Christ this is all so fucked up... We all become different people. 

#####[WARREN GROWS MORE UPSET AS HE KEEPS TALKING]

#### WARREN

_[shouting]_ He shouldn't be here. If I hadn't walked in that office that day, if I hadn't fed whatever it is that drives this ridiculous behaviour, he'd still be sat at his desk shopping for a fucking tortoise, in 2020, where he belongs. I made him come here, and he never left.

#### GORD

Would you like to listen to any more recordings?

##### [WARREN IGNORES HIM]

#### WARREN

Why am I awake? I mean, why now? What's the point of me just being in here on my own going out of my head?

#### GORD

Aubrey would like to discuss that-

#### WARREN

Yes, I would like that too. So why isn't she here? I’m awake, I'm me, how can this, how can me listening to nothing but tapes of him and your creepy voice be Plan A?

#### GORD

Aubrey would like to discuss these matters personally -

#### WARREN

It isn't Plan A, is it?

##### [NO ANSWER]

#### WARREN

This isn't how it was meant to go, is it? Something's gone wrong.

#### GORD

Warren, I think at this point we should take a moment to breathe and reflect -

#### WARREN

Fuck. There is no we. Where's Aubrey? Is she even here?

##### [NO ANSWER]

#### WARREN

Hello?

##### [A NEW VOICE COMES OVER THE COMM]

#### AUBREY

I'm here, Warren.

##### [CUT]


----


#### WARREN

He's gonna die, isn't he?

#### AUBREY

If I believed that, there would be no point in keeping it from you.

#### WARREN

So, what's happening, why have you left me in here?

#### AUBREY

It's a very busy time right now, Warren...

#### WARREN

Oh, come on.

#### AUBREY

It's true! I assure you there was plenty of fuss when you first woke up. I know you're probably used to being the main event -

#### WARREN

Come again?

#### AUBREY

I'm just saying, this is a particularly complicated time right now -

#### WARREN

Why? Tell me why!

#### AUBREY

I can't explain one part without explaining the rest, and I can't explain the rest until you've seen it, and you can't see it until you're out of quarantine.

#### WARREN

Then let me out, I'm fine. Is this even a real thing, or are you just watching me to make sure I don't stab myself in the hand or something?

#### AUBREY

Quarantine is quite real, Warren. It's been 44 years. We need to give you treatment to make sure you're safe out here. And we need to make sure you haven't brought anything dangerous with you. There was some nasty stuff around back then.

#### WARREN

You haven't told me anything Aubrey. I don't even know how we're still at Red Valley, it's been 44 years, what even happened out there-

#### AUBREY

You and Gordon were put in hypersleep in the two available cryopods. I sealed you in the tunnel below the station and destroyed any access in or out.

#### WARREN

And no one has come looking -

#### AUBREY

I sealed you in. I buried the whole lab.

#### WARREN

How?

#### AUBREY

With explosives. Took a lot of work to get back in here you know.

#### WARREN

I - do you even know what you sound like to me? -

#### AUBREY

_[calmly]_ Warren. What matters right now is that you're safe. The answers will come. I know that nothing I'm saying or doing right now is helping very much. And you're right, this isn't exactly how I wanted to do things. I'm sorry, but here we are. I guess this was never going to be easy. But I need you to trust me. We're doing everything we can for Gordon.

#### WARREN

Okay. Thank you, I guess.

#### AUBREY

I really can't stay I'm afraid. But it won't be much longer. Alright?

#### WARREN

Alright.

#### AUBREY

Alright.

##### [AUBREY PAUSES BEFORE SIGNING OFF]

#### AUBREY

You shouldn't blame yourself you know. Gordon was always going to end up here, one way or the other. You heard him on those tapes.

#### WARREN

Maybe. The day I met him, it changed things. You can't pretend otherwise. And that's on me.

#### AUBREY

You know that's exactly how I feel when it comes to you. All we can do now is try and make things better. While there's still time.

#### WARREN

_[exhasperated]_ Oh, what do you mean while there's still tim-

#### AUBREY

Oh my God, it's a turn of phrase! It doesn't mean anything!

#### WARREN

You cannot help it, can you? You have to be dramatic!

#### AUBREY

I do not!

#### WARREN

You do so!

#### AUBREY

Oh, go to sleep!

##### [AUBREY CLICKS OFF]
##### [PAUSE]

#### WARREN

Gord?

#### GORD

I'm here.

#### WARREN

You ran to mum when I threw the breakfast bowl, didn't you?

#### GORD

I can only do so much in my capacity as a caregiver.

#### WARREN

'Caregiver.'

##### [WARREN LETS OUT A BREATH, CALMER NOW]

#### GORD

Would you like to return to the memoir?

#### WARREN

I don't know.

#### GORD

There are multiple recordings related to you.

#### WARREN

Yeah... I don't need to hear any of those right now.

#### GORD

Okay.

#### WARREN

How… how does it end?

#### GORD

The memoir?

#### WARREN

Yeah.

#### GORD

It hasn't ended.

#### WARREN

Humm… Of course, let’s… let’s be optimistic. To be continued.

#### GORD

Indeed.

#### WARREN

Well… Go on then.

#### GORD

Go on what?

#### WARREN

Give me another Porlock haiku.

##### [A SLIGHT PAUSE]

#### GORD

The pink-footed goose. Its squawk heralds a new day. Covered in bird shit.

#### WARREN

Excellent. It’s very on brand. How many of these have you got?

#### GORD

119.

##### [WARREN SITS DOWN ON HIS BED]

#### WARREN

We best crack on then.

#### GORD

Metropolis zone. Is where I always give up. Just a faff, I think.
