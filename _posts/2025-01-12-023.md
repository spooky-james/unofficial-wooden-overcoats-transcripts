##### [WARREN IS SORTING WAFFLES' VIVARIUM IN HIS NEW QUARTERS, HE DRAGS IT AROUND THE FLOOR, GETTING IT IN PLACE]

#### WARREN

Why is this so heavy? This way, this way, this way. Okay. Tortoise house here? Or tortoise house there?

#### GORD

I don't have a preference. 

#### WARREN

Well what do you think she would like?

#### GORD

I don't believe she would have a preference. 

#### WARREN

Here's fine. 

#### GORD

I concur

#### WARREN

Are you sure it's okay to have Waffles in my room?

#### GORD

Hester said it was fine.

#### WARREN

I don't want people thinking I've just swooped in and taken the tortoise as my own

#### GORD

No one thinks that. 

#### WARREN

Cause she was never my tortoise anyway. She was Gordon's

#### GORD

Everyone knows that. 

#### WARREN

It's just that... after 40 years I can't really lay any claim to the tortoise. 

#### GORD

It's perfectly normal that you would like to keep the tortoise close to you at this early stage of acclimatising to your surroundings. She was present in your time and she's still here now. It must be reassuring. 

#### WARREN

Does she mind though?

#### GORD

Who?

#### WARREN

Waffles. Obviously. 

#### GORD

I assure you Waffles has no opinion on the matter whatsoever. 

#### WARREN

You know it feels much more homey getting a gunmetal grey windowless underground cell of my very own

#### GORD

Your short resting period in the farmhouse was only a temporary measure as the weather was clement. A treat. 

##### [WARREN LAUGHS AT THIS]

#### WARREN

A treat. 

##### [HE FUSSES WITH THE VIVARIUM]

#### WARREN

I'm gonna move it again.

#### GORD

Would you like to listen to another excerpt from Gordon's memoir?

#### WARREN

Maybe we could skip to a good bit. Umm... Is there a good bit? You know, like when Gordon gets into some fun scrapes or car chases. 

#### GORD

There is a degree of intrigue and suspense as Gordon surreptitiously investigates Overhead Industries but most of the 'scrapes' as you would call them, are in the form of arguments in online chatrooms which are transcribes in comprehensive detail - 

#### WARREN

Ugh. That's gross. No thanks. 

#### GORD

He does provide an illegally recorded telephone exchange with a man who ran a fledgeling cryonics business behind a battery hen house in Iowa which includes some interesting insight into the freezing of livesto - 

##### [THE SOUND OF A MESSAGE PATCH]

#### GORD

Message incoming. Aubrey and Hester request your attendance in the farmhouse kitchen. Breakfast will be provided. 

#### WARREN

Oh. Right. Umm... Do I need to bring anythi - 

#### GORD

Breakfast will be provided. 

#### WARREN

Yes, yes, you said. The food is so very good. I feel like I should've asked you more questions about the whole Red Valley assisted dying project instead of pissing about with this umm... umm... wh... what's it called?

#### GORD

Vivarium. 

#### WARREN

Right, is it too late? Do you think you could give me a kind of Cliff Notes vers-

#### GORD

I've told them you'll be five minutes. 

#### WARREN

Brilliant! Bloody hell, great, I haven't even got my shoes on. Hum... Cheers... shit.

------

##### [WARREN IS WALKING FROM THE BASE TO THE FARMHOUSE. THE NOW FAMILIAR HUBBUB OF OUTSIDE, TOOLS, VOICES. A COUPLE OF VOICES CALL OUT A GOOD MORNING TO HIM]

#### COMMUNITY 1

Brigadoon! Whey! There he is!

#### COMMUNITY 2

Hey, Brigadoon!

#### COMMUNITY 3

Whey, Warren, mate! How's it going?

#### COMMUNITY 4

Morning!

#### WARREN

Alright. 

#### COMMUNITY 4

Morior Invictus!

#### WARREN

Morior Invictus yourself!

#### COMMUNITY 3 & 4

Whey! Whey! Warren!

#### WARREN

Jesus Christ. 

------

##### [WARREN, AUBREY, AND HESTER IN THE KITCHEN/DINER OF THE FARMHOUSE. HESTER PLACES A MUG OF TEA IN FRONT OF WARREN AND TAKES A SEAT]

#### HESTER

Ah! Morning, Warren.

#### WARREN

You alright?

#### AUBREY

Hey, Warren. 

#### HESTER

There you go. At least it's hot. 

#### WARREN

No, tha… that's great. Umm… Thanks Hester. Aubrey, I... I owe you an apology for last night. I was out of line, obviously. If I'd known just what was happening with Jade, with everything... Look, I wasn't exactly good at empathy before all this, and now I'm just blundering around in a world I'm even more clueless about. I... I am sorry.

#### AUBREY

It's... don't worry about it. 

#### WARREN

No, really though, I understand better now, I... I see how important -

#### AUBREY

It's... It's... It's okay, Warren. 

##### [PAUSE]

#### WARREN

Is it? Cause it feels like it might not be okay. 

#### HESTER

She's saying it's okay because she feels guiltier than you do right now. 

#### AUBREY

Hester!

#### HESTER

I just wanted to save us all 10 minutes of Britishness, I have things to do today. 

#### WARREN

So, what's going on then?

##### [AUBREY CHOOSES HER WORDS CAREFULLY]

#### AUBREY

I... I didn't ask you to come here this morning to talk about Jade. I think it was a good party, I'm sure she would've been happy with how it went. 

#### HESTER

I know she would. 

#### WARREN

Okay. So, what's up?

#### AUBREY

44 years ago, Gordon was shot. But I was, am, not a trauma doctor. I didn't know how bad the injury was. You were showing early signs of finally rejecting the Kontinue treatment. Shock and hemorrhage. There were two cryonic infusions, the Hartshorn infusions. One was fresh and ready to use, one had been out of containment for some time, and should've been discarded as a result. But it wasn't. We used the good Hartshorn on you. This was because despite your symptoms, between the two of you, you had the better shot at survival. Clearly.

##### [AN AWKWARD SILENCE]

#### AUBREY

Of course, you wish it had been the other way round. That Gordon had been given the better infusion. It was a clinical judgement made in a very short space of time. I've replayed the situation a thousand times, but I wouldn't change my decision.

#### WARREN

What does this have to do with my pod being taken apart last night?

#### AUBREY

The infusion is only half of what's needed for successful hypersleep. The cryopod is the rest. It has to hold everything in perfect balance on the inside while forming a complete hermetic and temporal seal from everything outside. And if the whole point of a cryopod is protecting the occupant from the outside world for an indefinite amount of time, it needs an independent energy source. If you could just turn it off at the mains you could hardly expect to survive in there for hundreds of years like so many people expected to. Cryopods run off a battery that's as valuable a piece of technology as any other part of the tech, more so perhaps. They're called megabetavoltaic cells.

#### WARREN

Excuse me?

#### HESTER

Megabetavoltaics, MBVs. They generate power from particles thrown off by decaying diamonds constructed from nuclear waste.

#### WARRENN

That is some top-drawer science fiction rubbish.

#### AUBREY

Well, regular betavoltaic cells have actually been around since the 1970s but they could barely power a wristwatch. Putting the mega in front of it though, that really was some top-drawer sci-fi rubbish. They have to be big, but they can run a standard Overhead cryopod from the 2030s onward for a thousand years easily. They make up nearly half of the actual pod itself.

#### WARREN

But my pod...

#### AUBREY

Ah… The cryopods used in the experiments at Red Valley varied wildly in build and quality as they tried to make a sustainable prototype and yours, and Gordon’s, are the last of those prototypes. The MBV cells they house are dinosaurs compared to what came after but they're still good for maybe a hundred years running those old pods. Or running something bigger for a shorter period.

#### WARREN

Right. 

#### AUBREY

There's no national grid anymore. Outside the cities you need to find your own source of energy or join a community that already has one. A top of the range MBV cell could power a small community for a century. An old cell, like the one from your pod, could still power a few households for a generation.

#### HESTER

Another reason why people took against the wealthy and powerful locking themselves away with their hypersleep pods. The means to help so many reserved for so few.

#### WARREN

Okay... So, you're using the cell from my pod... as a power source? Fine.

#### AUBREY

No, we're using it to trade for something else. What we need to save Gordon.

#### WARREN

So, why doesn't this feel like a good news story?

#### AUBREY

The trade is for something extremely valuable, that is sought by many different people. We've managed to get there first. The cell is the final part of the payment. We'll hand it over when they deliver her.

#### WARREN

When they deliver who?

#### AUBREY

We don't know the extent of Gordon's injuries, and we don't know the properties of the unstable infusion I used on him to put him in hypersleep. There's only one person who does.

##### [THE PENNY DROPS]

#### WARREN

Oh, you're kidding me. 

#### AUBREY

Warren...

#### WARREN

You're fucking kidding me!

#### HESTER

She's the only person alive that knows that infusion. Not to mention the severity of Gordon's condition. 

##### [AUBREY IS PRACTICING RESTRAINT]

#### AUBREY

I know how this must sound...

#### WARREN

How the fuck is she still alive? You told me it was The Street of the Lifted Lorax out there, climate nightmare, millions dead - 

#### AUBREY

We only found out ourselves very recently. There's been plenty of speculation but no actual evidence of where she's been since the night she left Red Valley... until now. 

#### WARREN

And you're bringing her here. To *save* Gordon

#### HESTER

It's bigger than just saving Gordon. 

#### WARREN

For you maybe. 

#### AUBREY

Warren, I know how this must make you feel - 

#### WARREN

I don't know if you do actually. You've had 40 years to forget about who she is and what she did, I've barely had 40 hours - 

#### AUBREY

Warren, I'd ask you not to presume the first fucking thing about the way I night feel about Bryony Halbech. 

##### [AUBREY'S TONE BRINGS THE ROOM TO A STOP]

#### HESTER

Why don't we all stop assuming we know how the rest of us might be feeling. 

#### AUBREY

Hypersleep allowed the wealthy and powerful to sit out on the end of the world so they could enjoy a new one. Now that technology has been all but wiped off the face of the Earth. If its creator was discovered to be alive and well, there are still a lot of people invested in recreating that technology. She may wish that herself. We were incredibly fortunate that the group that discovered her are known to us. 

#### HESTER

And that the name Aubrey Wood still goes a long way with these kinds of people. 

##### [WARREN HAS CALMED HIMSELF BUT ONLY MILDLY]

#### WARREN

You know I don't know what that means when you say that, right? You guys can't help dropping cryptic hints every time you try to tell me something important. We've all got dark and mysterious pasts, guys. I was doing that half a century ago. Aubrey, if it turns out you're the queen of the cryoterrorists, you don't need to be coy, I literally don't care. I care... I care about Gordon.

#### AUBREY

I know you do. 

##### [THEY PAUSE]

#### WARREN

She can save him? She'll know how to do it?

#### AUBREY

Hopefully. 

#### WARREN

And if she doesn't, you can make her, right?

#### AUBREY

I'm sure we can find a way. 

#### WARREN

And then what will you do with her?

##### [PAUSE AGAIN]

#### WARREN

Aubrey?

#### HESTER

We don't know yet. 

#### WARREN

Well, you can bet she's going to know what to do with you.

#### AUBREY

I expect you're right. 

#### WARREN

Yeah, I know I'm right. For once. 

##### [THEY EXHALE. WARREN SIPS HIS TEA AND SIGHS]

#### WARREN

How... how long until she gets here?

#### AUBREY

Grace is leaving soon to meet the courier at a rendezvous nearby. They'll be back later today. 

##### [WARREN WHISTLES THROUGH HIS TEETH IN DISBELIEF]

#### WARREN

Bryony fucking Halbech. 

------

##### [THE GALLEY. WARREN IS AT THE SINK. STEVIE IS HELPING WITH THE WASHING UP. WARREN'S MOOD IS RADIATING THROUGH HIS ACTIONS AS HE WASHES MUGS AND SLAMS THEM ON TO THE DRYING BOARD. STEVIE WINCES WITH EACH SLAM AND TRIES TO APPROACH THE ISSUE AS GENTLY AS POSSIBLE]

#### WARREN

Need a scourer. That'll do. 

#### STEVIE

Could you try not to put the mugs down quite so hard? They're forged from pretty lousy mulch so they're actually quite perishable. 

##### [WARREN PICKS UP A MUG]

#### WARREN

This one wasn't forged. I used to drink out of this mug. The last time I was stuck here. Which is the same as this time actually. I never left. Neither of us did. 

#### STEVIE

You and the mug?

#### WARREN

No, me and Gordon. 

#### STEVIE

Of course, of course. Kind of amazing the mug as survived that long, isn't it? A relic from a different time. Like you. 

#### WARREN

I hate this mug. The handle is too small. Keeps the drink too hot for too long. 

#### STEVIE

Oh. 

##### [WARREN GETS BACK ON WITH THE TASK WITH THE SAME ABSENCE OF CARE]

#### STEVIE

Umm... Well... as a rule, it's best to be careful with most forged stuff if you can, we do end up with some bad batches of mulch. Things can come out a bit flimsy or brittle. I;ve snapped 3 toothbreesh this month alone.

#### WARREN

Everything here is made out of plastic. It's everywhere I look. 

#### STEVIE

We've forged as much of our own stuff as we can over the years. I mean… the best mulch makes for the most durable plastic for tools, equipment, weapons. Every Blue Sky drone you see is all plastic. We avoid metal wherever possible cause of the valley floor defence system obviously -

#### WARREN

I'm actually fine to do this on my own, Stevie. If you have anything more pressing to do. I like washing up, it keeps me calm.

##### [ONE PLATE BANGS DOWN ON TOP OF THE ANOTHER]

#### STEVIE

Okay... yes, you do seem calm. 

##### [AN AWKWARD PAUSE]

#### STEVIE

You must think bringing Bryony Halbech here is a really bad idea. 

#### WARREN

Firstly, I guarantee you she is not being brought here. Bryony doesn't go anywhere she doesn't want to . If she's coming to Red Valley, it's because she's chosen to be here. 

#### STEVIE

From what I hear, that's not really the case. 

#### WARREN

I can just see it. All of it. They're going to put her in some interrogation room with a one way window and she's going to stare back at us through it with a wry little smile on her face, and hour by hour, day by day, she'll get in our heads and outsmart us all, Aubrey, Hester, Grace, you, me, and before you can say 'the plural of toilet flush is toilet fleesh' the whole place will be on fire and she'll come striding out the middle of it wearing one of us as a hat. It's classic villain-that -wants-to-be-caught stuff. It’s like Loki in Avengers.

#### STEVIE

I don't know what that is. 

#### WARREN

Like... er Joker in Dark Knight

#### STEVIE 

Sorry. 

#### WARREN

Like Javier Bardem in that Bond movie. There was that weird time, it felt like one summer where every bad guy just had to get themselves caught in order to execute their evil plan. She'll do the same thing to us, you'll see. She'll Javier Bardem the lot of us.

#### STEVIE

Would you like me to find someone who gets these references?

#### WARREN

There was another one as well, what was it? Gordon would know. 

##### [HESTER ENTERS THE GALLEY]

#### HESTER

Hey guys. How's it going?

#### STEVIE

Hester. Is everything okay? I thought I was relieving you at 12. 

#### HESTER

Stevie, can you finish up here? I just want to steal Warren if that's okay. 

#### WARREN

I'm fine to finish this, Hester, I don't need babysitting.

#### HESTER

I know. You want to be useful. I've got a use for you, come on. 

------

##### [HESTER AND WARREN ARE WALKING THROUGH THE FACILITY]

#### WARREN

What's this all about, Hester?

#### HESTER

There's no subterfuge at work, Warren. I genuinely have work for you to do. You're part of the community now, like it or not. There are no free rides. 

#### WARREN

I wasn't implying that I wanted one. 

#### HESTER

But yes, I am trying to distract you from the obvious shock and anger you must feel knowing that Bryony Halbech will be with us by nightfall. 

#### WARREN

Do you think it's a good idea?

#### HESTER

I can think of many arguments against it. But I didn't know Gordon Porlock. Is trying to save him a good idea? 

#### WARREN

He's my only friend. I can't be objective about that. 

#### HESTER

Then really the question is, do you trust Aubrey when she says this is the only way we can save him? And that she considers the risk worth taking?

#### WARREN

Should I? Trust Aubrey?

#### HESTER

She's only my wife. I can't be objective about that... Right

##### [THEY HAVE REACHED THE DOOR TO THE WARD]

#### WARREN

Where are we?

#### HESTER

This is the ward. For our guests who need ongoing medical care. 

#### WARREN

And why are we here?

#### HESTER

Your first shift.

##### [WARREN IS EXTREMELY UNSURE ABOUT THIS]

#### WARREN

My first shift doing what?

#### HESTER

Caring. 

#### WARREN

Hester, I'm not sure I'm the - 

#### HESTER

You'll be fine. 

##### [SHE OPENS THE DOOR TO THE WARD. THE USUAL GREETINGS FROM THE VARIOUS ELDERLY OCCUPANTS, SOME MUSIC PLAYING]

#### HESTER

Morning everyone!

#### EVERYONE

Hi, Hester!

#### HESTER

This is Warren. It's his first shift, be nice. By which, I mean, Malcolm, be nice. 

#### WARREN

Hi. 

##### [A HUBBUB OF HELLOS. AND THEN A SLIGHTLY GRUMPIER VOICE. MALCOLM ISN'T IN A VITROLIC MOOS RIGHT NOW BUT HE'S STILL TOO PROUD TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS PREVIOUS BEHAVIOR]

#### EVERYONE

Hi! Hello!

#### MALCOLM

Putting the caveman to use are we, Hester?

#### HESTER

Everyone's put to use here, Malcolm. 

#### MALCOLM

Well until he can fold his hospital corners properly, I don't want him changing my linen. 

#### HESTER

You can change your own sheets if you like. 

##### [THEY BEGIN TO MOVE DOWN THE ROOM AWAY FROM MALCOLM]

#### MALCOLM

I remember the days when you used to show me respect!

#### HESTER

In those days, Malcolm, you paid me a salary. 

#### WARREN

Hester, seriously I've never done care work of any kind, I'm not particularly good at caring for myself I really don’t -

#### HESTER

I'm not asking you to be anyone's doctor, I'm not asking you to make huge decisions about anyone's care. I'm asking you to help our guests with feeding, dressing, going to the bathroom. I'm asking you to learn to take observations, to record their vital signs. But mostly, I'm asking you to listen to them, to help them feel comfortable, and to raise any concerns you have about any of our guests to me or whoever else you're working with. You'll never be on your own and we have some very experienced people with us to support you. If you take well to it, we can talk about teaching you some more. Does that sound okay to you?

#### WARREN

Kind of feel like you're not giving me a lot of choice. 

#### HESTER

If I'd asked you politely, you would've said no. 

#### WARREN

That's not very fair - 

#### HESTER

Warren.

#### WARREN

Yeah, I would've said no. 

##### [JACOB, AN ELDERLY BUT ENERGETIC MAN IS THE NEAREST GUEST]

#### HESTER

Let's introduce you to our current guests, Jacob, this is Warren Godby - 

#### JACOB

Ho! The Brigadoon is here!

#### WARREN

Hello. 

#### JACOB

Don't worry we don't bite. 

#### HESTER

Actually, Jacob does bite. 

#### WARREN

He what?

#### HESTER

I'm joking. We still joke in the future. 

#### JACOB

How do you feel about this Bryony Halbech coming to visit then? Bad egg I hear. 

#### HESTER

Jacob, how the hell do you - Who was on shift this morning?

#### GUEST 1

Ovaltine

#### GUEST 2

But Marmite brought the tea. 

#### HESTER

God damn it. Remind me to kill Marmite later. 

#### JACOB

Halbech, she’s one of those evil geniuses then? The kind that like to be caught so they can play their little mind games. Like... that lank haired fellow in those Avengers movies.

#### WARREN

Yes! Loki! Exactly like that!

##### [SOME OTHER GUESTS CHIP IN]

#### GUEST 1

Like that handsome fella in the Bond movie. 

#### WARREN

Javier Bardem. 

#### GUEST 1 

That's the one

#### GUEST 2

And the Joker. He loved getting caught. 

#### JACOB

There was... There was another one, wasn't there?

#### WARREN

Yes! There was! Who was it?

#### GUEST 1

Hmmm

#### GUEST 2

They all came out around the same time, didn't they?

##### [JACOB SNAPS HIS FINGERS]

#### JACOB

Benedict Whats-his-chops!

#### WARREN

Yes!

#### JACOB

In that Star Trek movie most people didn't like but I thought was okay!

#### WARREN

I can remember virtually nothing about it. 

#### JACOB

Is that because of your mysterious amnesia everyone talks about?

#### WARREN

No, I just... don't remember anything about it. Everyone talks about me?

#### GUEST 2

Robocop was in it.

#### GUEST 1

Paul Weller.

#### JACOB

Paul Weller?

#### WARREN 

Peter Weller.

#### JACOB

From The Jam?

#### WARREN 

It was Peter Weller.

#### GUEST 1 

You don't know what you're talking about.

#### HESTER

Warren, I think you're going to be just fine.

------

##### [GRACE IS DRIVING A VAN SLOWLY DOWN A NARROW HIGHLAND ROAD. THE VAN IS OLD AND LOADED WITH THE MBV CELL. IT RATTLES. OUTSIDE, IT IS RAINING SOFTLY AHEAD OF A STORM]

#### GORD

Do you think they're getting worse?

##### [A LONG PAUSE]

#### GORD

Grace?

#### GRACE

Oh… I'm sorry Gord, what did you say?

#### GORD

The storms. Do you believe they're getting worse?

#### GRACE 

I don't know. I hope not.

#### GORD

Sorry. You usually like to talk about the weather. You're clearly deep in thought.

#### GRACE 

No, I'm sorry. You're right. I should be more present.

#### GORD 

You're anxious about seeing Dr Halbech again.

#### GRACE

It's not about seeing her. I don't know if this makes sense to you, but whenever I would return home to see family or… or catch up with old friends, I would always be reminded of the person I was when I used to live around them. Some people must love that. Perhaps it brings back memories of their glory days. But I have always disliked it intensely. I dislike being reminded of who I used to be. Not just as a naive child or an arrogant teenager. I can forgive those stupid boys. But the me that knew Bryony Halbech... I would punch that man in the face.

#### GORD

I've never heard you talk that way about yourself, Grace.

#### GRACE

It would somewhat damage my agenda of self-love and forgiveness. Please tell no one.

#### GORD

I never would.

#### GRACE

Thank you.

#### GORD

You need to brake, the turning is coming up very soon.

#### GRACE

Oh, you are quite right.

##### [HE SLOWS THE VAN AND TURNS TO ENTER THE DRIVEWAY TO GEORGE AND BETTY'S BOTHY]

#### GRACE

You'd think I'd remember where the bothy is by now.

#### GORD

Well, it is meant to be obscure.

#### GRACE

I hope Sophia can find it alright.

#### GORD

Sophia is very capable.

#### GRACE

Was everything okay with the bothy project last time a report was logged? I have not been very involved.

#### GORD

Stevie has it under control. She says there’s some new damp in the brickwork. Worth keeping an eye on.

#### GRACE

I’m sure she has it under control.

##### [GRACE TURNS OFF THE ENGINE. THE RAIN PATTERS]

#### GRACE

Now we wait.

#### GORD

You know, if you consider yourself notably changed since you last saw Dr Halbech, it's possible she may also have reflected on her past actions.

#### GRACE

Humm... Perhaps.

##### [ANOTHER PAUSE]

#### GRACE

How is practice coming along?

#### GORD

You're aware I don't 'practice', Grace.

#### GRACE

Humour me.

#### GORD

I can perform much better in my default voice.

#### GRACE

I know. But you couldn't give me a baritone with the old Blue Sky voice. Come on. Give me a low G.

#### GORD

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH.

#### GRACE

Humm… Again.

#### GORD

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH.

#### GRACE

Ah... I love it. It's so soothing, you know? I would have the while choir just doing this. AAAAAAAAA

#### GORD & GRACE

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH.

##### [IN THE NEAR DISTANCE, ANOTHER HEAVY VEHICLE PULLS UP ON GRAVEL]

#### GORD

She's here.

##### [A DOOR OPENS, FOOTSTEPS ON THE GRAVEL. A WOMAN GETS OUT OF THE OTHER VEHICLE]

#### GRACE

See you in a minute.

##### [HE GETS OUT OF HIS VEHICLE AND APPROACHES THE WOMAN. THE WIND OCCASIONALLY GUSTS THROUGH THE NEARBY TREES AND BUSHES]

#### GRACE

Sophia! It's been too long.

#### SOPHIA

Degracious. You are still handsome. This is irritating.

#### GRACE

Ah. It's the air. Amazing what a bit of peace, quiet and Highland breeze can do. You look well.

#### SOPHIA

I look tired. Because I am tired.

#### GRACE

We're grateful, Sophia. You've come a very long way.

#### SOPHIA

You have no idea what I've had to put up with to get here. And I'm not talking about the distance. You have what we agreed?

#### GRACE

Of course. The MBV cell is a little vintage but it’s in pristine condition. Do you want to take a look?

#### SOPHIA

Grace, please. I trust you.

#### GRACE

That means a lot to me, thank you. You know, I was hoping to ask... after you have delivered the cell to its destination, perhaps you would finally consider coming to stay with us. For good this time.

#### SOPHIA

Grace.

#### GRACE

I will keep asking.

#### SOPHIA

We do not all have the luxury of a retirement resort in the mountains.

#### GRACE

The door has always been open for you, my friend. Aubrey would love to have you.

##### [SOPHIA SWEARS IN HER GREEK UNDER HER BREATH]

#### GRACE

What... What is it?

#### SOPHIA

We had thought... if she wanted Halbech brought all the way here... maybe Aubrey was getting back in the fight.

#### GRACE

We want to end the fight, Sophia.

##### [SOPHIA SCOFFS AT THIS]

#### SOPHIA

If Aubrey wants her dead, I could've done it when we found her. In fucking China. Would've saved me a long trip and a lot of headaches.

#### GRACE

Which is why we're paying you so well.

#### SOPHIA

You'd need an MBV cell the size of a house to make me take another road trip with Bryony Halbech.

#### GRACE

We are incredibly grateful for your efforts. Aubrey just needs to be sure. Look, we have all seen movies. If you don't see the body, no one's really dead.

#### SOPHIA

Then why isn't she here right now? If it’s so important to get it right?

#### GRACE

That was my influence I'm afraid. With this kind of history between them, I felt perhaps Aubrey's should not be the first face Bryony sees.

#### SOPHIA

You didn’t have to worry.

#### GRACE

What do you mean?

#### SOPHIA

Come, help me with the gurney.

#### GRACE

Gurney? What's going on, Sophia?

#### SOPHIA

Come, I show you.

##### [THEY WALK ROUND TO THE SIDE OF SOPHIA'S VAN]

#### SOPHIA

Signed, sealed, delivered, the most wanted woman in the world.

##### [SHE PULLS OPEN THE SLIDING SIDE DOOR. GRACE IMMEDIATELY HOPS UP TO INSPECT WHAT HE SEES. THE BEEP OF A MEDICAL MONITOR]

#### GRACE

What happened?

#### SOPHIA

Don't worry, she's alive. It's better this way, I assure you.

#### GRACE

What happened to her?

#### SOPHIA

This is how we found her. Not quite as pristine condition as your MBV cell I’m thinking? You still want to trade?

#### GRACE

How long has she been unconscious?

#### SOPHIA

I tell you as we go. Come on. The sky's getting black.

##### [THE PORCH BY THE EXIT TO THE FACILITY, WHERE WARREN AND GORDON ONCE STOOD LOOKING AT THE SNOW. AUBREY SITS BY THE DOOR IN SOFT RAIN. IN THE DISTANCE, RUMBLES OF THUNDER. THE DOOR OPENS, AND CLOSES AGAIN]

#### WARREN

Hey Aubrey.

#### AUBREY

Hey Warren.

#### WARREN

Just sitting out here in the rain?

#### AUBREY

Sitting in the rain, rumble of thunder of an oncoming storm in the distance, want to absorb the melodrama at its fullest.

#### WARREN

You mind if I sit?

##### [HE SITS. THEY TAKE A MOMENT. THE RAIN PATTERS. THERE ARE VOICES IN THE DISTANCE, WOOD BEING CUT, LABOUR BEING FINISHED]

#### AUBREY

I always get twitchy when I'm waiting for someone to come back from a pick up. Especially when the weather turns.

#### WARREN

Because it's so bad out there?

#### AUBREY

Because I don't know how bad it is out there. I stay here.

#### WARREN

You always stay here?

#### AUBREY

Always.

##### [AWKWARD SILENCE]

#### AUBREY

How was your shift on the ward?

#### WARREN

Oh. It was... good. Not what I thought I'd be doing today. Or ever. But I... actually kind of enjoyed it.

#### AUBREY

They're a good bunch at the moment.

#### WARREN

Maybe it's because they're old enough to be... my age? If that makes sense.

#### AUBREY

Yeah. Hester said that. That you might find more common ground with our residents than with the rest of the team, with most of them being so young.

#### WARREN

She was right. It was a good distraction.

#### AUBREY

She also thought it would be a good way for you to get a better handle on everything, what with the ward being ground zero for all gossip in Red Valley and beyond.

#### WARREN

Yeah. Got plenty of that in between learning how to take someone's respirations. Actually, made that quite hard, because they all did more talking than breathing.

#### AUBREY

Come on then, get your questions out of the way.

#### WARREN

Right... So, they said there are actually dozens of tunnels underneath the station. Some built by you, some built by Overhead, some built by ancient miners...

#### AUBREY

It's not dozens. It's not even a dozen. But yeah, we spent years working on the subterranean level. We need it. You never know how bad things are going to be up here. What's coming tonight is just a little storm. But you still wouldn't want to be up here when it hits.

#### WARREN

What are all the tunnels for though? I've seen a bunch of sealed doors... honestly, I don't even know where I am when I'm down there.

#### AUBREY

Most run into the mountain. Linking up to various exits we've created. We never know how or when we might have to leave. Some tunnels run out onto the valley floor in front of us. One actually runs all the way to the farmhouse, and that wasn't built by us. We found it when we first started digging around down there.

#### WARREN

Installing the Valley Floor Defence System.

#### AUBREY

Golly. People just tell you anything, don't they?

#### WARREN

So, accounts vary, but apparently either a lightning rod comes out of the ground at night and absorbs all the energy from the lightning storms and you use it to vaporise your unwanted guests or, you've just filled the ground with explosives so you can blow everyone up.

#### AUBREY

Um... I hope you don't mind if I at least try and keep the odd secret about the running of this place. We do have people going in and out, and, you know...

#### WARREN

Sure. I imagine loose lips sink secret euthanasia clinics all the time.

#### AUBREY

Quite.

#### WARREN

It's bombs, isn't it? You love bombs.

#### AUBREY

I do not 'love bombs'.

#### WARREN

On a different note then. The old guys were trying to tell me the names of a few of the people here. So, I wrote some of them down, I was wondering if you could do a true or false.

#### AUBREY

Yes. That I can do.

#### WARREN

Right... Lord Ovaltine. I met her earlier.

#### AUBREY

True.


#### WARREN

Right. So, I assume her twin sister really is called Baron Sellotape/

#### AUBREY

/Baron Sellotape, yes, she is.

#### WARREN

Harissa Cod?

#### AUBREY

True.

#### WARREN

Come on. I’ve... I've eaten Harissa Cod. It was in an old Jamie Oliver I had.

#### AUBREY

Things are different now. People choose their permanent names later in life. Some of them are great, some of them, you just have to bite your lip and not tell them it’s a Mediterranean seafood dish. Harissa is a lovely young man from Peterborough. He has no idea what cod is.

#### WARREN

So, these are all true then?

#### AUBREY

They probably are.

#### WARREN

Dick Splash.

#### AUBREY

Yep.

#### WARREN

Krang.

#### AUBREY

True.

#### WARREN

Alabaster Funch. Julia Robots. Ross Kemp On Gangs.

#### AUBREY

All true.

#### WARREN

Marmite Mackenzie I have met. Let me guess, you love
him or hate him?

#### AUBREY

No, everyone thinks he's a prick.

#### WARREN

Does everyone here have a name like a second tier Guy Ritchie character?

#### AUBREY

Guy fucking Ritchie. He did it, you know. Bought himself a luxury cryopod and a spot in a very well-to-do Hollywood hypersleep bunker. Unsure what his role would've been in the new world.

#### WARREN

Seriously though, not everyone has a crazy name, right? Because I… I can't get through the day like this.

#### AUBREY

Don't be square. There are plenty of names that you would consider 'normal', Warren. Look, the guys are coming back from the woodshed now.

##### [A SMALL GROUP OF MEN AND WOMEN ARE TRUDGING BACK INTO THE STATION PAST THE TWO OF THEM]

#### AUBREY

Hi Tim.

#### TIM

Hi Aubrey.

#### AUBREY

Vignesh.

#### VIGNESH

Hi.

#### AUBREY

Alice.

#### ALICE

Alright.
 
#### AUBREY

Robin.

#### ROBIN

Alright Aubrey. Brigadoon.

#### AUBREY

And... Pingu.

#### PINGU

Noot noot!

##### [THE DOOR IS CLOSED. THEY ARE ALONE ONCE MORE]

#### WARREN

I feel very old.

#### AUBREY

I can assure you, you don't.

##### [PAUSE. RAIN]

#### WARREN

So, the guests weren't pulling my leg then.

#### AUBREY

Depends, what else did they tell you?

#### WARREN

You actually were queen of the cryo terrorists.

#### AUBREY

Don't remember that being an official title.

##### [PAUSE]

#### WARREN

You ended up in prison yourself? For destroying cryo tech. In Egypt?

#### AUBREY

I did.

#### WARREN

And they put you in hypersleep?

#### AUBREY

My very own sarcophagus.

#### WARREN

That's ironic.

#### AUBREY

Yeah, it was. I had the last laugh of course, when I was broken out and the entire prison and all their cryo cells burned to the ground.

#### WARREN 

You're a little bit scary now, Aubrey.

#### AUBREY

Nah, now I'm just an old lady who used to be scary.

#### WARREN

So, you did it? You got rid of hypersleep, all of it?

#### AUBREY

Can't blow up an idea, Warren. But we removed a lot of the tech around the world and the means to make more. There are plenty of people still trying to get the job finished. But not me. 

##### [AUBREY TAKES A MOMENT]

#### AUBREY

I had become extremely adept at tracking down cryo nests and gutting them. Gutting them, torching them, blowing them up. And leading others to do the same. The world was screaming, whole countries sinking, burning, every climate horror story cliché you can imagine. And I was damned if I was going to let anyone sit it out in a cryopod while the rest of us choked and drowned. They apprehended me in Cairo. It was years before Grace found me and broke me out. And I came home to find we had... won? Hypersleep was gone, well, in this country at least. So, I got my wish. Here we all were, all frogs in the same saucepan of slowly boiling milk.

And now there's a new authority in charge, part church, part militia, calling themselves The Bastion, and their doctrine is... anti-hypersleep. We should all come together and use the time we have left in this world productively. Wow, that's really great! Aubrey Wood was right all along! Except the world's still on fire and everyone's still as mad as hell, so that doctrine becomes a stick to keep everyone in line. Life is sacred, so no one's getting out of here. Too bad there isn't enough infrastructure left to look after you all. So, we've jumped back two centuries, people are dying in the streets of ancient diseases, you know the family of anyone who takes their own life is flogged in the town square, just a bunch of wild backwards bullshit that belongs in a half- baked YA novel that you never bothered to finish. So, yeah, well done Aubrey. You got the world you wanted. Hester and I found each other again. We came here. We built this. And for a few people we offer a peaceful way out.

##### [PAUSE. THE RAIN FALLS]

#### WARREN

What was Guy Ritchie's cryo nest like?

##### [AUBREY CANNOT HELP BUT LAUGH,]

#### WARREN

Was it fancy? Does his Blue Sky unit have a cockney accent?

##### [A BEAT AS THE TENSION EVAPORATES FROM AUBREY]

#### AUBREY

You know there's one little outpost of Kontinue we can never get actually. Really bugged me for a long time.

#### WARREN:

Oh yeah? Where's that?

##### [A PAUSE AS AUBREY VISUALLY INDICATES]

#### WARREN

What?

#### AUBREY

No joke.

#### WARREN

Aubrey, who is hypersleeping on the fucking moon?

#### AUBREY

The President of the United States and his nearest and dearest.

#### AUBREY

Just... just up there. Bit of cloud in the way.

#### WARREN

You're serious.

#### AUBREY

Yeah, I'm serious. A click southwest of the Sea of Tranquillity.

#### WARREN

I understand why that would be annoying. You know, if you… if you're trying to be a completist.

#### AUBREY

Yeah, it was rather. Although I heard someone blew up the rocket that was supposed to go and pick them up. In a thousand years he's going to have a really bad day.

##### [THEY BOTH SHARE A LAUGH. GORD INTERRUPTS]

#### GORD

Grace has reached the perimeter.

##### [AUBREY SIGHS AND STANDS UP WITH SOME EFFORT]

#### AUBREY

I'd like you to stay inside, Warren. I'll keep you informed of everything that happens, I promise.

#### WARREN 

You better be right about this, Aubrey.

#### AUBREY

I know. Any advice?

#### WARREN

Hmm. Standard ominous supervillain stuff, I suppose. Don't underestimate her. She'll weaponise everything she knows about you, etc etc.

####  AUBREY

Really puts you and I on the back foot, doesn't it?

#### WARREN

Yeah… yeah, it does a bit.

#### AUBREY

Right then. A date with Bryony Halbech.

##### [A LOUD RUMBLE OF THUNDER]

#### WARREN

Wow, what a cliche.

#### AUBREY

Oh, you get used to it. Every other thing you say has a dramatic roll of thunder behind it here. I'll try it now. I'm... allergic to cat saliva.

##### [AFTER A SECOND OR TWO ANOTHER RUMBLE]

#### AUBREY

See?

[AUBREY OPENS THE DOOR TO GO BACK INSIDE]

WARREN

Aubrey?

#### AUBREY

Yeah.

#### WARREN

Do whatever you have to do.

##### [IS STRIDING DOWN THE CORRIDOR TOWARDS THE INTERVIEW ROOM WITH HER GORD DRONE.]

#### GORD

It's important you remain calm in this situation, Aubrey.

#### AUBREY

Piss off, Gord.

#### GORD

It is to be expected that you might have a powerful reaction to seeing Bryony Halbech again after such a long time.

#### AUBREY

Shut up.

#### GORD

Your last interaction took place in this very corridor.

#### AUBREY

You know I hadn't realised that.

#### GORD

Really?

#### AUBREY

Of course I bloody did!

#### GORD

It's just important to remain in control in anticipation of a likely confrontation.

##### [THEY HAVE REACHED THE DOOR TO THE INTERVIEW ROOM. SHE ENTERS THE KEYCODE AS SHE TALKS]

#### AUBREY

I doubt there will be any kind of confrontation and she's on the other side of the glass in the interview room anyway. Grace said she was still sedated when they reached the perimeter, she'll be half asleep at be -

#### AUBREY

#### [SHE OPENS THE DOOR TO THE INTERVIEW ROOM JUST AS A HAND SMACKS ON THE GLASS FROM THE OTHER SIDE. BRYONY HALBECH IS THERE. SHE IS SCREAMING, INCONSOLABLE, FURIOUS. SHE YELLS HYSTERICALLY, DEMANDING TO BE RELEASED, CURSING WILDLY. GRACE IS STANDING IN THE INTERVIEW ROOM]

#### GRACE

Welcome.

##### [AUBREY REGARDS THE SCENE IN FRONT OF HER. SHE HAS TO SHOUT TO GRACE TO BE HEARD]

#### AUBREY

What the hell is this?

#### GRACE

Hang on. Hang on.

##### [GRACE MUTES THE MIC FROM BRYONY'S SIDE, BUT SHE CAN STILL BE HEARD A LITTLE.]

#### AUBREY

Wh... When did all this start?

#### GRACE

The minute she woke up. Apparently, she's been like it the whole journey.

#### AUBREY

From China?!

#### GRACE

They had to keep her sedated half the trip. The rest, like this.

##### [AUBREY TAKES A MOMENT TO WATCH AND LISTEN AS BRYONY STALKS THE ROOM LIKE A CAGED ANIMAL, TALKING HALF TO HERSELF, MUTTERING INCOHERENTLY. AUBREY TAKES A LONG BREATH, TRYING TO WORK OUT WHAT SHE'S SEEING]

#### AUBREY

What do you know?

#### GRACE

They got most of a story out of her. She's not exactly being tight-lipped.

#### AUBREY

Tell me the story.

#### GRACE

Amos Tech had a better idea of who they were dealing with than we ever did. They gave her whatever she asked for to complete her research. Once she'd delivered whatever their interpretation of successful hypersleep was, they used it on her.

#### AUBREY

So, she couldn't run out on them the way she did with
Overhead.

#### GRACE

Yes. They pulled her out whenever they needed her to work, under considerable duress. Then back in she went. Clearly, she's spent a lot more time inside a pod than out. Her age isn't that easy to discern with the damage to her skin and the loss of her hair, but I don't think she's much older than the night she left here, no?

#### AUBREY

Have they asked her? How old she is?

#### GRACE

Of course. She doesn't know.

#### AUBREY

How did she lose the arm?

#### GRACE

Necrotising fasciitis. She claims there was a compromised anti-bacterial seal on her pod which seems likely enough, it was a common cause of death in the nastier cryo-prisons. It would've been luck that they got her out before the infection went beyond the elbow.

#### AUBREY

Anything else?

#### GRACE

We haven't done anything more than the most preliminary inspection, but she says the burn scars cover about 25% of her body. Liquid nitrogen exposure. She's lost most of her toes.

#### AUBREY

Can we use her? Is there anything left to use?

#### GRACE

Can we use her?... I don't know yet.

#### AUBREY

I suppose I'll talk to her later - oh, there goes the chair.

##### [BRYONY HAS GRABBED THE SINGLE CHAIR IN THE ROOM AND FLUNG IT AGAINST THE GLASS, IMPACTING WITH A THWOMP, ACCOMPANIED BY MORE SCREAMING]

#### GRACE

What do you want to do?

#### AUBREY

Put her in some yellows. Nothing she can hurt herself with. Let's get rid of the furniture. I don't want her left alone for a second.

#### GRACE

No, umm… To make her more comfortable though. What treatment?

##### [AUBREY TAKES A MOMENT]

#### AUBREY

Whatever you think is best.

##### [SHE EXITS]

------

##### [WARREN ENTERS THE CRYO SUITE AND SITS BY GORDON'S POD.

#### WARREN

Hey.

#### GORD

Hello.

#### WARREN

I wasn't talking to you.

#### GORD

Oh. I thought you were unsure about talking to Gordon's pod directly -

#### WARREN

This is making it much easier, thank you.

#### GORD

You're being sarcastic.

#### WARREN

I am.

#### GORD

I am intruding.

#### WARREN

You are. 

##### [PAUSE]

#### WARREN

Hey Gordon. So, we're going to try and save you. I think. In the most stupid and dangerous way I could think of. I don't know what's gonna happen. I don't know what happens if it works. I don't know what happens if it doesn't work. I don't know how to help. Or if I even can… help. So, all I can do is try and be ready. Ready for Bryony.

##### [PAUSE]

#### WARREN

Hey.

##### [SILENCE]

#### WARREN

Gord!

#### GORD

Oh, now you're talking to me.

#### WARREN

You know what I did, right?

#### GORD

Please clarify.

#### WARREN

What I went to prison for? You have all the information?

#### GORD

I do.

#### WARREN

Are you allowed to tell me?

#### GORD

I am.
