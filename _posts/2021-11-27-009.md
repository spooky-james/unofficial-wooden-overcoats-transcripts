#### WARREN

_[weak and fatigued]_ Do I just sit right here? 

#### GRACE

Yes please, Warren.

##### [HE SITS DOWN]
##### [AN AWKWARD PAUSE]

#### WARREN

Umm… Is there something you’d like me to do? 

#### GRACE

No, no. Just er… getting things - there. Okay. Can we start the tape? 

#### GORDON

Oh… I've already started the tape. 

#### GRACE

Of course you have. 

#### WARREN

Gordon? Is that you? 

#### GORDON

Hi Warren! 

#### WARREN

Will I actually be able to see you now after this? Like are they going to let me out? 

#### GORDON

Oh, yeah, I think so -  

#### GRACE

Your quarantine period is up, this is just an important part of study that we - 

#### WARREN

Yes, yeah of course, whatever you need. I’m just really eager for some fresh air. 

#### GRACE

Of course, of course. So. March 14th, 2020. This is just a short memory test. The treatment for your first period of hypersleep resulted in significant disruption of your short-term memory, as you might recall. Or not. As the case may be.  

#### WARREN

Okay, yeah.

#### GRACE

Through adjustments to your treatment for this second period of hypersleep, we hope to have avoided this damage to your memory going forward. Initial observations in the 72 hours since your emergence -  

#### WARREN

Sorry, Dr Melé? 

#### GRACE

Yes?

#### WARREN

Sorry,. It's just, it is really cold in here, could I get a blanket or something? 

#### PAMELA

There's one just behind the chair actually, Warren. 

#### WARREN

Oh, hi Dr Jennings. 

#### PAMELA

Please, call me Pamela. Or Pam. 

#### GRACE

If we could stay focused - 

#### PAMELA

He's cold. The air con is right over his head.  

#### WARREN

Where is it - oh.  

#### GRACE

In the 72 hours since your emergence -  

#### WARREN

Ooh, it's er… it’s really scratchy. Like in a nice way, but yeah scratchy. Um… I am allergic to wool. This is… oh this is wool, isn't it? 

#### GORDON

Wait is that a problem? Do we need to get him out of there? 

#### GRACE

In the 72 hours since your emergence! The results have been very encouraging. You've displayed recognition, recall, neuro obs all strong, seemingly fully compos mentis. We're just here today to keep an eye on things, a few simple questions. 

#### WARREN

Brilliant, thanks.

#### GRACE

Could you tell me your full name, please? 

#### WARREN

I can, it’s Warren William Godby. 

#### GRACE

And your date of birth? 

#### WARREN

That is September the 25th. 

#### GRACE

Can you tell me where you are right now? 

#### WARREN

I'm in your interrogation room? 

#### GRACE

It's actually an interview room, but I meant where in general. 

#### GORDON

Wasn't much of an interview last time he was in there.  

#### GRACE

Excuse me?  

#### GORDON

It wasn't much of an interview. Clive was very mean to Warren and he threatened to kill me a couple of times. 

#### PAMELA

And then Warren broke his nose. 

#### WARREN

So sorry about that, by the way. 

#### GRACE

Gordon you don't have to be here actually. 

#### WARREN

I'm archiving like Bryony wanted me to.  

#### GRACE

Well, maybe we need to speak to Dr Halbech about the exact nature of  -  

#### PAMELA

We just want to know where you think you are in general, Warren. 

#### GRACE

Pam, I'm quite capable of conducting this inter-  

#### WARREN

The Red Valley Seed Vault! Er, that’s it. Or just Red Valley, whatever it is that you call it now. 

#### GRACE

And er… where is that? 

#### WARREN

Scotland um... Quite high up. Sorry I don't, don’t actually know how far. Off the A9 somewhere. 

##### [A LITTLE MOMENT OF SILENCE]

#### WARREN

Oh! Ballbag! 

#### GRACE

I'm sorry?

#### WARREN

We're in the shadow of the mighty Ballbag. That’s what you call the mountain isn't it? I don't actually remember what it's really called. 

#### GRACE

The mountain is Beinn Bagg. 

#### WARREN

Yes, yes that's it! That's not because I've got amnesia or anything. I just literally forgot that. Like anyone would. 

#### GRACE

Can you tell me the last thing you remember before commencing this period of hypersleep? 

#### WARREN

Uhuh, Gordon and I were on a road trip to find Red Valley, erm… for my work, and we found it, clearly. And then we came downstairs and Clive Schill was there and he was all like, ooh, surprise, and there was cheesecake or something...and then I met both of you, and you were all 'this way Mr Godby' and off we went... and then I was in here again, like you were just discussing, with the headbutting and, uh, my life… that’s all made up, um. Then I went to sleep. Hyper...magic sleep. And now I'm back. 

I Continued! That's, that’s what you want to call it isn't it? Continue but with a special K, was that it? 

#### GRACE

Yes and how do you feel about that? 

#### WARREN

I mean it's catchy, I think it would go down quite well. The K is a bit much. mean unless you've already decided? In which case, I love it. 

#### GRACE

No, no, no I mean how do you feel? About your situation? 

#### WARREN

Oh. Well, fine, more or less. I mean a bit of a hangover but that’s probably to be expected after 3 months of being clinically dead, I guess? Nothing a few Beroccas wouldn’t fix I'm sure.  

#### GRACE

I meant emotionally though, Warren. How do you feel? 

#### PAMELA

Why are you ask -  

##### [SHE IS CUT OFF]
##### [WARREN WAITS A MOMENT]

#### WARREN

Hello? 

##### [THE SPEAKER COMES BACK TO LIFE SUDDENLY]
##### [THERE IS A SLIGHT PAUSE BEFORE ANYONE SPEAKS]

#### GRACE

Why did you keep your name, Warren? 

#### WARREN

What the f -  

##### [CUTS OUT
##### [PAUSE]

#### WARREN

My name, sorry? 

##### [MUFFLED VOICES]

#### GRACE

- for me to decide. 

#### PAMELA

No it isn't. 

#### GORDON

Let's get Bryony. 

#### GRACE

Don't even think about it -  

#### GORDON

You suggested it first, I'm just agreeing -  

#### WARREN

Everything okay in there guys? 

##### [MUFFLED VOICES CONTINUE]

Guys?

##### [A PAUSE, AND A LITTLE SQUEAL AS THE SPEAKER COMES BACK ON SUDDENLY]

#### GRACE

Your name. Why did you keep it? 

#### WARREN

Is this still a memory test? 

#### GRACE

Yes.

#### WARREN

I… I don't understand the question. 

#### GRACE

You left your home town after your mother's death never to return. Your father William Godby was a sex offender and domestic abuser. You wanted to start over again yet you still carried his name. Warren William Godby. Did you not think to change it? 

#### PAMELA

Dr Melé, outside now! 

##### [A DOOR SLAMS IN THE DISTANCE]
##### [HURRIED FOOTSTEPS DOWN THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE INTERVIEW ROOM]
##### [MUFFLED VOICES - PAMELA AND GORDON'S]

#### WARREN

Everything alright out there? 

##### [NO ANSWER]

Er… Okay. Well, my father, he already had a criminal record for petty crimes when he met my Mum. When they married they took her last name for a chance at a new start, I suppose. She chose the name Warren herself after her umm… favourite uncle. My Dad wasn't present at the birth anyway.  

##### [STILL NO REPLY]

You know I think I am actually properly allergic to this blanket. I… I have a rash. 

##### [SILENCE FROM GRACE]
##### [THE MUFFLED DISCUSSION IN THE CORRIDOR CONTINUES]

#### GRACE

That's great Warren, that'll be all for now. 

#### WARREN

Okay. Can I go now? 

##### [NOTHING]
##### [EVENTUALLY THE DOOR OPENS]

#### GORDON

Warren. 

#### WARREN

Gordon bloody Porlock. 

#### GORDON

How about some fresh air? 

##### [CUT]


------


#### GORDON

It's bloody cold outside. Kind of a blizzard actually. 

#### WARREN

Aw, is it snowing? 

#### GORDON

Oh yeah, yeah, been this way for weeks. It’s fun at first but a bit much after a while. 

#### WARREN

That's cos you've had no one to play with.  

##### [THE DOOR OPENS AT THE OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR]

#### GORDON

Oh man.  

#### WARREN

Yeah.

#### CLIVE

Stop all the clocks! Prevent the dog from barking with a big juicy bone! 

#### WARREN

This is disconcerting. 

#### CLIVE

Warren fucking Godby! The man, the myth, the bellend! 

#### WARREN

Hi Clive. 

##### [CLIVE CLAPS HIS ARM ON WARREN'S SHOULDER, MAKING HIM ALMOST STUMBLE]

#### CLIVE

You look great. Alright Games Workshop, here take this would you. 

##### [CLIVE DUMPS A HEAVY RUCKSACK ON GORDON]

#### GORDON

...Sure. 

#### CLIVE

How do you feel? 

#### WARREN

Is this another test? 

#### CLIVE

How do you mean? 

#### WARREN

How do I feel, like, physically or emotionally? 

#### CLIVE

How do I feel, like, physically or emotionally? 

#### WARREN

I’m fine then. 

#### CLIVE

Yeah, seriously though, how are you? Everything working? You all there? 

##### [HE CLICKS HIS FINGERS IN WARREN'S FACE AS THE DOOR OPENS AGAIN]

#### BRYONY

Give him some space, Clive. 

#### CLIVE

He looks good. A bit pasty. Does he get Vitamin D when he's down there? 

#### GORDON

We were just on our way outside actually. 

#### BRYONY

Very good. 

#### CLIVE

Why do you want to go outside? It's a blizzard. 

#### WARREN & GORDON

Just want some fresh air. 

#### BRYONY

Let them go outside Clive. 

#### WARREN

Thanks. 

#### BRYONY

Not at all.  

##### [WARREN AND GORDON STRIDE PAST BRYONY AND CLIVE AND GET TO THE DOOR]
##### [THERE'S A RUSTLE AS THEY PULL ON COATS]
##### [BRYONY AND CLIVE ARE HAVING A BUSY, UNINTELLIGIBLE CONVERSATION IN THE DISTANCE]

#### WARREN

Clive seems a little...stressed. 

#### GORDON

Wait till we're outside.    

##### [CUT]
##### [THE WIND BLOWS BUT IT'S TRANQUIL COMPARED TO THE CONSTANT BEEPS AND BOOPS INDOORS]
##### [WARREN TAKES A DEEP BREATH]

#### GORDON

So, I was going to ask how you feel but I think you've probably had enough of that for today. 

#### WARREN

Maybe yeah. Look at this snow though. It's gorgeous.  

##### [HE CRUNCHES HIS BOOTS UP AND DOWN IN THE SNOW]

So, three months. Kept yourself busy? 

#### GORDON

Oh… Yeah. The archiving is really fascinating, you know, if you're into elaborate human rights abuses in the name of theoretical science, which apparently I am

#### WARREN

Yeah, I bet you are. 

#### GORDON

The caretaking stuff though, I have no idea. I think they assumed I might be handy, like, be able to actually look after the place or something. I thought I'd just wing it with YouTube videos, that's what I did in my flat. This isn't really like putting up a widescreen tv bracket or building a gaming PC though. And this weather.  

#### WARREN

What's the place like? I barely made it through the front door before it went all Eastenders drum roll cliffhanger ending last time so I didn't really take much note of any of it. 

#### GORDON

Oh it's fun. There's the farmhouse, where you stayed the last time you were here, you remember that? 

#### WARREN

No.

#### GORDON

There's the mess room, they've got a pool table and a juke box, like an old working men's club kind of feel, you remember that? 

#### WARREN

No.

#### GORDON

They've got all these disused military bits and bobs from the Cold War, when it was a missile tracking station, like a situation room with these big world maps on perspex screens where you can move all this stuff around it’s very cool. And they've got those clocks all in a row that tell the time in different countries. You must remember that. 

#### WARREN

I'm just going to nip this in the bud and assure you I don't remember any part of ever being here. 

#### GORDON

Oh. Sorry. I guess I'm not really sure where your brain is at. 

#### WARREN

Well, my mind eggs don’t seem to be any more poached than they were before, but whatever was missing though, I don’t think is coming back.  

#### GORDON

Oh well. It could be a lot worse.  

#### WARREN

I can see you are busting to tell me more about this place, aren't you? 

#### GORDON

There are these old plans and blueprints from when they first built this place, they built it over some ancient granite mine, there are tunnels you can still go into, well, I mean one tunnel specifically, going right into the mountain to all these disused mineshafts, and Overhead were going to try out putting some kind of miniature reactor down there, like a nuclear reactor, as a test to see if they could power remote outposts all over...Look I'm sorry. I'm blabbering. I haven't had anyone to talk to about any of this. 

#### WARREN

It’s alright, it’s alright. Gordon, are you okay? 

#### GORDON

Oh yeah I'm fine. I'm fine. It's just been a bit solitary. But I wasn't exactly in the after work 5-aside football team before I got here, was I?   

#### WARREN

Umm… So how is...everyone else then? Are they treating you, ok? 

#### GORDON

Well Pam is nice. For a conscience-free cryonic scientist. And Grace is umm… 

#### WARREN

A wanker?

#### GORDON

Yeah. Keeps his nose so far up Bryony's...well. Oh er… Apparently things aren't going so well for Clive. I think he thought the first time you woke up everything was going to take off and he'd make his millions. Think he made some promises he couldn't keep to the directors. His eyes bulge a bit these days. And Bryony... well, Bryony is without doubt the scariest person I have ever met. 

#### WARREN

Yeah, right.

##### [THEY STAND IN SILENCE FOR A MOMENT]

Relieved is how I felt, by the way.

#### GORDON

Sorry?

#### WARREN

They wanted to know how I felt. After the freaking out and the headbutting way back when. When I was laid up in the bed and you were there. I felt… relief. Do you think that’s weird? 

#### GORDON

I know what you mean.

#### WARREN

You do? 

#### GORDON

I was scared of everything. I was scared of people. Talking to people on the phone. Or in person. Or anywhere. The idea of calling a customer service line because my wifi had gone down, or to haggle over upgrading my phone, that would make me sweat. And then I was here and it was all gone. I don't have to worry about well, any of that. You know when you're on a train, and it's held up, and you're just stuck in the middle of a field while they get leaves off the line or whatever, and you're going to be hopelessly late, there might be awful consequences to get stressed about but...there's literally nothing you can do about it. It's not your fault. Hopefully you've got a book or something. You're just sitting on the train.  

#### WARREN

You know that is exactly it. 

#### GORDON

Only with live-in cryonic scientists studying you in your home pretending to be your spouse, and prison sentences you can't remember and stuff like that.  

#### WARREN

Well. Yeah.

#### GORDON

I don't know what you did, you know. 

#### WARREN

They haven't told you? 

#### GORDON

I mean, the files are here. I just didn't look. 

#### WARREN

Why not? 

#### GORDON

I mean, it wasn't my place. 

#### WARREN

So, everyone else here knows.  

#### GORDON

Yeah.

#### WARREN

Is it weird that we're the only ones who don't? 

#### GORDON

Look it’s your call. I mean, you can look, or I can look, or neither of us can look, or whatever you like.  

#### WARREN

You're a really good friend, Gordon. I’m really sorry you’re caught up in all of this. 

#### GORDON

Shall we go back inside? 

#### WARREN

Do you think it’s alright if I just have a minute to myself? My head's kind of banging a bit. 

#### GORDON

Uh, er, yeah, yeah, sure. Here. Take my comm, I'll grab another one. Everyone uses channel 2 on the station. Why don't we use channel...6, just to talk to each other?

#### WARREN

That is a great idea.  

#### GORDON

Erm… See you in a minute.

##### [GORDON STEPS BACK TO THE DOOR, GOES INSIDE]
##### [INSIDE THE STATION, CLIVE AND BRYONY ARE STILL IN THE CORRIDOR] 

#### CLIVE

Where's he gone? 

#### GORDON

He's just having a minute. 

#### CLIVE

To do what? 

#### GORDON

To have a minute. It's his first time outside in 3 months. 

#### CLIVE

Get him back in. 

#### BRYONY

Clive, let him be. 

#### CLIVE

Since when did you get so protective over him? 

#### BRYONY

Since when did you get so protective over him? 

#### CLIVE

How do you know he isn't running for the hills right now? 

#### GORDON

He's not going to run -  

#### CLIVE

Get him in please. It's cold out there.  

#### GORDON

He's not a puppy. 

#### BRYONY

Fine, let’s get him indoors. 

##### [GORDON GOES TO THE DOOR]

#### GORDON

I think everyone's over-reacting. 

##### [HE OPENS IT AND STANDS THERE FOR A MINUTE]

#### CLIVE

Porlock. 

#### GORDON

Well. Don't I feel silly.  

##### [CUT]

##### [THE WIND HOWLS, BLOWING A BLIZZARD AROUND WARREN AS HE WANDERS FORWARD IN THE SNOW]
##### [HIS BREATHING IS HEAVY BUT HE IS ENTIRELY RELAXED]
##### [HIS COMM HISSES WITH STATIC]

#### GORDON (VO)

Warren! Warren are you there! 

##### [HE FINALLY STOPS, FUMBLES WITH THE COMM]

#### WARREN

Echo 3 to Echo 7, Han old buddy, do you read me? 

#### GORDON

Warren? 

#### WARREN

That's not the line, but whatever.  

#### GORDON

Where did you go! Clive's throwing a shit fit.  

#### WARREN

I just went for a walk. I love snow. And it's been three months, I wanted to stretch my legs. 

#### GORDON

When are you coming back? Everyone's worried. 

#### WARREN

I'm sure no one is 'worried'. 

#### GORDON

Well, I'm worried. 

#### WARREN

Well, I'm worried. 

#### GORDON

For myself! Clive smashed an office chair into the wall and now he's staring at the fire extinguisher like it insulted his mother. 

##### [NO ANSWER]

For myself! Clive smashed an office chair into the wall and now he's staring at the fire extinguisher like it insulted his mother. 

#### WARREN

What is that?

#### GORDON

What's what?

#### WARREN

Looks like headlights.

#### GORDON

Headlights?

#### WARREN

Yeah, but up in the hill?

#### GORDON

Warren what are you talking about, what lights? 

#### WARREN

That's a minivan.

#### GORDON

A minivan?

#### WARREN

That’s a Mazda Bongo Friendee. 

#### GORDON

A wait what?...say that again?

#### WARREN

A Mazda Bongo Friendee. 

#### GORDON

I think you're slurring Warren, are you feeling alright? 

#### WARREN

A Mazda.

#### GORDON

A Mazda?

#### WARREN

Bongo.

#### GORDON

Bungle?

#### WARREN

Friendee.

#### GORDON

Is your tongue swelling up? Is this what happened last time you were defrosted? 

#### WARREN

Oh… someone’s getting out. I’m going to say hello. 

#### GORDON

No, no, no Warren, turn around and come back! Come back

##### [NO ANSWER]

Motherfu - 

##### [CUT]

#### AUBREY

Stop. 

#### GORD

Would you like me to play the next entry, Aubrey? 

#### AUBREY

I guess it’s reassuring that Warren was just as big a pain in the arse when he woke up 40 years ago as he is right now. 

#### GORD

It is fortunate we have greater care options now than were available at that time. 

#### AUBREY

Doesn’t help Gordon though, does it? Now or then. Poor Gordon. I never gave him the credit he deserved for what he had to go through

#### GORD

The nature of your relationship did not lend itself to sentiment. 

#### AUBREY

It was a strange relationship, if you can even call it that. I met him in a subreddit on cryonic preservation. What was his username? From the movie, what was it? 

#### GORD

His username was John Spartan. The Sylvester Stallone character from Demolition Man. 

#### AUBREY

Yes, so I chose Simon Phoenix, the Wesley Snipes character, so we could get talking. All the while wikipediaing Demolition Man. Still haven't seen it.  

#### GORD

The reviews were resoundingly average. 

#### AUBREY

Two years of passing the strangest information over the internet with no idea whether he could be trusted or if he was just some loser stringing me along. I didn't even know if he was truly Overhead like he claimed, but he was someone who took me seriously, this insane story of hypersleep and dead test subjects in a ridiculous secret research facility in the Highlands. He promised me he would 'blow this shit wide open'. It petered out. Ben Thomas found other contacts for us to focus on. None of them came to anything. We couldn't get close enough to anyone to convince them we were telling the truth without revealing ourselves. It was impossible then. Overhead were everywhere. I didn't give Gordon any more thought. 

#### GORD

But then you met in real life. Here at Red Valley. 

#### AUBREY

I never even made eye contact with him, Gord. By the time we were in the same room together he...well you know what happened. I don't even know why I'm telling you any of this, you know it better than I do, better than anyone. Unclouded by guilt, or shame, or 40 years of twisting memories around until they're nothing like what really happened. 

#### GORD

That's why we're doing this. To remember what really happened. And if the plan is successful you will be able to meet Gordon face-to-fa -  

#### AUBREY

One thing at a time Gord. Bryony's already testing her theory though. Or is she? Is it just Grace trying to score points? Pushing a theory he doesn't even understand yet. None of them do. Warren's barely been out for five minutes, he must've been drugged up to his eyeballs. I'm surprised he could talk. But then he is surprising isn't he.  

##### [SHE SIGHS AND PUSHES HER CHAIR BACK, STANDING UP AND STRETCHING]

Wee break.

#### GORD

We can commence the next entry when you return. 

#### AUBREY

No, let it run, I'll only be a minute.  

#### GORD

What if you miss something? 

#### AUBREY

I won't. I remember the next part just fine.
