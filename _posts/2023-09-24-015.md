##### [CAR NOISES]
##### [THE PHONE IS RINGING]

#### PAMELA

Clive?

#### CLIVE

Pam. How's it going?

#### PAMELA

Clive, you can't keep doing this.

#### CLIVE

Doing what? I like to know you're okay.

#### PAMELA

No, you don't. Clive, it's stressing me out and in any case -

#### CLIVE

Pam, look. I'm in a taxi, I'm on my way to meet Fran Jones right now. She summoned me.

#### PAMELA

She summoned you?

#### CLIVE

Yeah, to a tapas restaurant. Pam, I want to make my pitch, I need something concrete from you and your guys -

#### PAMELA

Clive listen to me, you need to be careful -

##### [A BEEP SHOWS THAT CLIVE HAS A CALL WAITING]

#### CLIVE

What? Why?

#### PAMELA

Clive -

##### [BEEP]

#### CLIVE

Hang on. Stay on the line.

##### [A DIFFERENT BEEP AS HE TAKES THE OTHER CALL]

#### CLIVE

Harvey?

#### HARVEY

Clive, hi.

#### CLIVE

How's it going Harvey?

#### HARVEY

Have you got a minute?

#### CLIVE

Always got the time for my man at The Times.

#### HARVEY

Hahaha, Listen… I've got this story I've been asked to follow up on. We've had some striking material sent to us regarding some astonishing work going on at Amos Tech in China.

#### CLIVE

Riiight.

#### HARVEY

_[probing]_ It's in a pretty strange field of research. Cryonic preservation.

#### CLIVE

Cryonic...preservation?

#### HARVEY

The freezing of human bodies. In the hopes of one day resurrecting them.

#### CLIVE

Okay, so, why would I know anything about that?

#### HARVEY

Well, the intel that has been leaked depicts some extremely concerning treatment of human test subjects at Amos.

#### CLIVE

Yeah, I don't see what this has to do with me Harvey, you want a quote about how shoddy we think Amos Tech are, then you can go to the spokespeople, I can give you their number -

#### HARVEY

Well, the thing is, the source for the intel links this research to studies carried out by Overhead Industries -

#### CLIVE

Harvey, what is this?

#### HARVEY

I'm just looking for a little clarifica -

#### CLIVE

I don't know the first thing about cryogenics or -

#### HARVEY

Cryonics. And you do, there's the record of a patent for a liquid nitrogen storage pod for cadavers that your department acquired a few years ago, and the domain name doyouwanttokontinue.com with a k by the way, which your department bought in 2019 -

#### CLIVE

You're barking up the wrong tree here, mate.

#### HARVEY

What can you tell me about a Dr Bryony Halbech?

#### CLIVE

_[losing patience]_ Fucking hell Harvey! We're supposed to be friends! I introduced you to your mistress!

#### HARVEY

Clive, it's just a story man. I'm doing my job.

##### [CLIVE TAPS ON THE GLASS TO GET THE CAB DRIVER'S ATTENTION]

#### CLIVE

Just here mate.

#### CABBIE

You said Shaftesbury Avenue-

#### CLIVE

Here is fine!

##### [THE CAB PULLS UP, CLIVE THROWS MONEY AT THE DRIVER]

#### CLIVE

Keep the change.

##### [HE MAKES A BIT OF A PALAVA OF GETTING OUT OF THE CAR WITH THE CANE HE NEEDS TO WALK, STILL HOLDING HIS PHONE]
[HARVEY CARRIES ON]

#### HARVEY

So, you're not denying Overhead have been working on human cryonic preservation? Under the project name Kontinue? Using techniques that violate many of the-

#### CLIVE

You know the paywall bit of your website, when the text of your articles fades into nothingness? That is going to be the literal reality of your career, Harvey. You're going to disappear like that photo of Marty McFuckingFly. Write your garbage thinkpiece about cryotech, I'm sure it'll cook up a storm on reddit.com/nobodygivesashit. Say hello to your mistress for me.

#### HARVEY

Charlotte and I are getting married actually.

##### [CLIVE LAUGHS AT THIS]

#### CLIVE

Hoo boy, why don't you ask Charlotte how me and her met in the first place you plum.

#### HARVEY

What's that supposed to –

##### [CLIVE HANGS UP]
##### [HIS CANE CLACKS AGAINST THE PAVEMENT AS HE WALKS, QUICKLY]
##### [HE MAKES ANOTHER CALL - IT RINGS FOR SOME TIME BEFORE BEING ANSWERED]

#### CLIVE

Fuck sake.

#### PAMELA

_[weary]_ Clive, I'm at work.

#### CLIVE

Was that what I had to be careful about?

#### PAMELA

Was what?

#### CLIVE

I just had a call from that gobshite at The Times poking around some leak from Amos Tech, did he call you?

#### PAMELA

Yes, he did, but he left a voicemail, I didn't speak to him! Clive, please God tell me you didn't tell him anything.

#### CLIVE

Why the hell would I do that? Okay, look, you leave rubbish like that to me, you concentrate on being the best bloody cryo tech genius you can be.

#### PAMELA

You talk like we're a team. We're not a team. I have my own team now. I'm finally back doing something I love.

#### CLIVE

Yeah, you're building diamond-powered batteries that could let a cryopod run completely independently for a thousand years!

#### PAMELA

The research has a few more applications than a bloody cryopod, Clive -

#### CLIVE

Do you realise how cool that sounds though? Let me use it in my pitch. Help me, help you! I could get you some funding, we’ll get you out of that little lab in Bristol -

#### PAMELA

I like my little lab! Clive, I don't want you bringing up me or my work -

##### [CLIVE HAS STOPPED]

#### CLIVE

Oh, there she is. She looks terrible in blue.

#### PAMELA

What?

#### CLIVE

Francesca Jones. Sat there like she owns the place. Drinking her fizzy fucking water.

#### PAMELA

Where are you?

#### CLIVE

I can see her through the window. Where's Malcolm? I can't see him.

#### PAMELA

You're watching her through the window of the restaurant?

#### CLIVE

He's meant to be here, I need him to - oh. She's seen me.

#### PAMELA

Clive...

#### CLIVE

I'm waving.

#### PAMELA

Do you realise how much this sounds like an Alan Partridge bit?

#### CLIVE

I'm not Alan Partridge. I'm Jerry Maguire.

#### PAMELA

Don't bring my name up. Don't even think about it.

##### [SHE HANGS UP]
##### [CUT]

##### [CLIVE HAS ENTERED THE RESTAURANT, WHICH IS NOISY AND BUSTLING]
##### [HIS CANE CLACKS ON THE FLOOR]

#### FRONT OF HOUSE

Hello sir, do you have a booking?

#### CLIVE

Yep, I'm right over there with the electric blue power suit and boring drinks choices.

##### [HE CLACKS STRAIGHT PAST BEFORE CALLING BACK]

#### CLIVE

Actually, could you bring over an old fashioned?

#### FRONT OF HOUSE

Um, of course.

##### [HE WALKS TO THE TABLE]

#### CLIVE

Francesca. How are you?

#### FRANCESCA

Clive. I'm fine, how are you? Um, you found us alright.

#### CLIVE

Us? Is umm… Malcolm here then?

#### FRANCESCA

Malcolm couldn't be here.

#### CLIVE

_[disappointed]_ W-Why not?

##### [SOMEONE NEW SITS DOWN]

#### REBECCA

_[seriously]_ I'm afraid my father has been unwell, as I'm sure you've heard. He's asked me to help out for a while. Rebecca Landry, how do you do?

##### [SHUFFLING AS THEY SHAKE HANDS] 

#### CLIVE

Oh. Er… Lovely to meet you. Have we - have we not met before?

#### REBECCA

I don't think so, no. I haven't been involved with the company until now.

#### CLIVE

Oh right. Okay. But you're um... you’re up to speed with everything.

#### REBECCA

Absolutely.

#### FRANCESCA

Clive, now Rebecca's here we really should get started -

#### CLIVE

You're sure we haven't met before?

#### REBECCA

Quite sure.

#### FRANCESCA

Clive, we've asked you on a matter of some urgency -

##### [CLIVE SNAPS HIS FINGERS]

#### CLIVE

Bloody hell, she’s the voice of Blue Sky!

#### REBECCA

_[annoyed and barely hiding it]_ Yes. Yes, I am.

#### CLIVE

Malcolm got his own daughter to be the voice of the Overhead virtual assistant. I did not know that.

#### REBECCA

Now you do.

#### CLIVE

That must be so weird for you.

##### [HE SCRAMBLES FOR HIS PHONE]

#### REBECCA

It's...oh, you're going to, oh, okay -

#### CLIVE

Hey Blue Sky, what's the time?

#### BLUE SKY

_[in a voice unmistakably belonging to Rebecca Landry]_ The time in London is 3:27pm.

#### REBECCA

It's definitely not annoying at all when people do that.

#### CLIVE

It's like meeting a celebrity.

#### FRANCESCA

Clive. Amos Tech have a functioning hypersleep prototype and it’s going to be on the Chinese market before the end of the year.

##### [A SILENCE, INTERRUPTED BY THE ARRIVAL OF CLIVE'S DRINK]

#### FRONT OF HOUSE

Your old fashioned, sir.

##### [THE ICE TINKLES AS THE DRINK IS PLACED ON THE TABLE]
##### [HE TAKES A SIP]

#### CLIVE

How are they pushing it?

#### FRANCESCA

It's over Clive. Amos got there first.

#### CLIVE

How are they pushing it?

#### REBECCA

Why does that matter?

#### CLIVE

Just because they got there first, doesn't mean they got there right.

#### FRANCESCA

Overhead's slogan is literally 'The Future, First.' It's printed on your business card.

#### REBECCA

They're using it in the penal system.

#### CLIVE

Well, there you go. I've been saying this all along. It's not a utility or a punishment, it's a lifestyle choice -

#### FRANCESCA

Clive -

#### CLIVE

You use it on convicts, and you've made it dirty tech, the big money will go nowhere near it. You don't want to read thatmBilly Bugnuts who murdered his wife with a meat tenderiser is getting 10 years in hypersleep, you want to see it on a Kardashian's Instagram, you want to see it on a SpaceX rocket going to Saturn -

#### REBECCA

That's not actually what we're here to discuss.

#### CLIVE

You've got to let me talk to you about the Aloha Eternity.

#### REBECCA

The what?

#### FRANCESCA

Rebecca, don't get him started -

#### CLIVE

The Aloha Eternity, it's a patent I secured a year ago. A cruise ship for cryonics. First developed by Sebastian Bedford, philanthropist, big thinker, terrible public speaker. The rich and the dying spend the end of their days seeing the world on a top of the range cruise liner, right. Ticking all their bucket lists in the most beautiful locations in the world, with a team on hand to freeze them the moment they shuffle off their mortal coil, safe in the knowledge that with Kontinue, Overhead have taken the pioneering step in cryonic preservation technology -

#### FRANCESCA

Except we haven't. Amos Tech have.

#### CLIVE

They don't even realise what they've got.

#### FRANCESCA

Clive -

#### CLIVE

Just let me show you my presentation.

#### FRANCESCA

Clive! I don't appreciate having to raise my voice in public!

#### CLIVE

Then why are we meeting in a fucking tapas restaurant! I don't even have a menu!

#### REBECCA

Mr Schill, we asked to meet because we want to talk to you about something that's been brought to our attention.

##### [REBECCA PRODUCES A FILE AND PLACES IT IN FRONT OF CLIVE]

#### CLIVE

Um hmm.

#### REBECCA

If you could look at the file.

##### [HE LEAFS THROUGH IT UNENTHUSIASTICALLY]

#### CLIVE

This is... this is inside Amos.

#### REBECCA

Yes.

#### CLIVE

What am I looking at?

#### REBECCA

Someone took these pictures inside the cryo development lab at Amos.

#### CLIVE

Who?

#### REBECCA

We don't know who took them, but we know who sent them, because she attached and signed a covering letter.

#### CLIVE

She?

#### FRANCESCA

Aubrey Wood.

#### CLIVE

Bloody hell, she's stepping up her game, isn't she? I take it we're no closer to finding her?

#### REBECCA

In her letter, she states that the men and women in these pictures are undergoing some kind of neurological treatment that rapidly enlarges the subject's amygdala while shrinking their hippocampus at the same rate.

##### [CLIVE SQUINTS AS HE LOOKS THROUGH THE PICTURES]

#### CLIVE

Then she can see a lot more than I can.

#### REBECCA

This creates a neurological state that appears to tolerate the cryonic preservative infusion that allows for successful resuscitation from prolonged hypersleep.

#### CLIVE

Well, hooray for Amos Tech!

#### FRANCESCA

This neurological state is an artificial recreation of what would commonly be recognised as PTSD.

#### REBECCA

Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

#### CLIVE

I know what PTSD is.

#### FRANCESCA

It's being given to otherwise fit and healthy individuals. Probably against their will. It's a human rights atrocity. Does that ring any bells, Clive?

#### CLIVE

Are you sure you guys wouldn't rather discuss this back at your office?

#### FRANCESCA

Because it reminds me very much of the last conversation I had with Bryony Halbech, do you remember it?

#### CLIVE

Do I remember the day Bryony shot my kneecaps off?

##### [HE TAPS HIS CANE AGAINST THE TABLE]

#### CLIVE

Hmm… Let me think.

#### FRANCESCA

I think, that it’s safe to assume that Bryony Halbech is behind this research at Amos.

#### CLIVE

One should never assume, Fran.

#### REBECCA

Mr Schill, I'm not sure you fully appreciate the gravity of the situation in which you find yourself. The scope of your failure is wider than you think.

#### CLIVE

Oh right. Do elaborate.

#### REBECCA

After the destruction of the cryonics laboratory at Red Valley in which valuable assets in your care were stolen or destroyed -

#### CLIVE

Such as my kneecaps.

#### REBECCA

You assured Francesca and my father that you could locate Bryony Halbech within 2 weeks.

#### CLIVE

I was in a hospital bed when I said that. Following surgery. Do I have to say the word kneecaps again?

#### REBECCA

That was 2 years ago. You still haven't found her.

#### CLIVE

I'm… I’m Clive Schill by the way, I work in research and development. You still seem to have me confused with The Mandalorian.

#### REBECCA

During this period, it would appear that Dr Halbech has perfected her research into human cryonic preservation by taking it to our biggest competitor.

#### CLIVE

I feel like you're building up to a third thing.

#### REBECCA

Now, that research has been leaked and shared by an ex- Overhead employee who seems hellbent on stopping the development of human cryo tech in any form. This file hasn't just gone to us. We have reason to believe it's reached the press.

#### CLIVE

I got a phone call from a newspaper about this just before I walked in here, that's a strange coincidence.

#### REBECCA

I'm not sure quite what you're implying, Mr Schill.

#### CLIVE

I don't see Bryony Halbech in any of these pictures, do you? Actually, is there any hard evidence she's at Amos? Or that she's even alive for that matter?

#### FRANCESCA

They've done exactly what she asked us to do 2 years ago, Clive.

#### CLIVE

What she asked you to do in the function room of a pub before going on an attempted killing spree. Now, forgive me if I don't take the words of a homicidal maniac that seriously. And sorry, but I'm struggling to see how Aubrey Wood leaking human rights abuses from our biggest rival is actually a bad thing. Now, if you'd like me to take responsibility for the PR shitshow that’s about to head Amos' way, I'm happy to do it.

#### REBECCA

Clive -

#### CLIVE

You think I don't know what this is? I see an Overhead board of directors that’s lost its fucking nerve. Why do you think Amos, Jinx, Chapter, every new tech on the block, why do you think they're beating us? And they are beating us, aren't they? So, Amos got there first in cryo. It's not what any of us wanted. But your first reaction is to take everything we've done, everything we've achieved, tie it to a brick with my name on it and throw it in the sea? Because you're scared of a little poking from a nobody at The Times and a nuisance ex-employee with a grudge? Does Malcolm even know you're meeting with me today?

#### REBECCA

As I've said, my father is unwell -

#### CLIVE

Your father would look at this file and laugh until he broke a tooth. His mind would open like a motherfucking flower to the possibilities it presented, it wouldn’t shrink in fear and doubt.

#### FRANCESCA

Well, you've made a jolly spectacle of yourself as usual Clive, so I suppose we're done here.

#### CLIVE

You suppose correctly. You want to walk away from Kontinue, fine. But if you think you can leave all the trouble at my feet, you'll find I dotted my i's and crossed my t's with some pretty wild fucking penmanship. Enjoy your £30 calamari rings or whatever the fuck.

##### [THE SCRAPE OF CLIVE'S CHAIR AND THE TAP OF HIS CANE ON THE GROUND AS HE STANDS]

#### REBECCA

It was a pleasure to meet you, Mr Schill.

#### CLIVE

You too Rebecca. I look forward to being served by you in five years at the Overhead all night pharmacy or whatever is left of this company when you're finished with it. That's your future. But hey, at least you'll have got there first.

##### [HE DEPARTS THE RESTAURANT, HIS CANE CLACKING ON THE FLOOR]

#### CLIVE

_[muttering]_ That was some Jerry Maguire shit right there.
