##### [A SHIP HORN SOUNDS]
##### [QUICK STEPS, A CANE CLACKING ON A CORRIDOR FLOOR]
##### [A CLICK OFF A COMM]

#### CLIVE

Pam? Pam. Pam!

##### [NO ANSWER]

#### CLIVE

Dr Jennings! Cardiac arrest on the retail deck!

##### [OVER THE COMM, A THROAT IS CLEARED, GENERAL KERFUFFLE]

#### PAMELA

_[panicked]_ What! Where? I'm here, I'm here!

#### CLIVE

And where is here?

#### PAMELA

Clive. Oh… Fuck.

#### CLIVE

Where are you?

#### PAMELA

I'm... actually, I don't know. Lots of sand. Some plastic guy in a lot of eyeliner is looking at me like I owe him money. Is there actually a cardiac arrest going on?

#### CLIVE

No. And that's the Pharoah. You're in The Mighty Sphinx. That's the other side of the ship, Pam! She's already landing, you're supposed to be here.

#### PAMELA

I think it's best for everyone, if I skip the meet and greet.

#### CLIVE

I told you I wanted you to be there, Pam. You're the chief cryonicist. You're technically the most important person on the vessel.

#### PAMELA

Ah! I'd like that in writing.

#### CLIVE

Pam it’s 11am. Right. I don't care if you have a drinking problem, can you just make it less visible?

#### PAMELA

You have a visible drinking problem.

#### CLIVE

I'm allowed to have a visible drinking problem. I don't have tovitrify anyone's corporeal remains.

#### PAMELA

I'm gonna go. Say hi to the boss from me.

#### CLIVE

We'll find you later.

#### PAMELA

It's a big ship. Goodnight.

#### CLIVE

It's 11am!

#### TOMAS

Good morning, sir.

#### CLIVE

Tomas!

#### TOMAS

Your guest has landed, sir. The rotors on the helicopter are just slowing. You may want to wait a moment.

#### CLIVE

Nope.

#### TOMAS

Very good, sir.

#### CLIVE

You looking forward to Rio, Tomas?

#### TOMAS

Absolutely, sir.

#### CLIVE

Beautiful girls.

#### TOMAS

Yes, sir.

##### [TOMAS OPENS A DOOR]

##### [THE SOUND OF THE OCEAN IN THE DISTANCE]
##### [A HELICOPTER ENGINE FADES AWAY]
##### [TAPPING FROM CLIVE'S CANE]

#### CLIVE

Rebecca! Welcome aboard the Aloha Eternity.

#### REBECCA

I didn't expect you to greet me, Clive, I assume your head is needed to anchor the ship.

##### [REBECCA DOESN'T BREAK HER STRIDE]

#### CLIVE

How was your journey?

#### REBECCA

Less luxurious than yours but a good deal more tasteful, I expect. The all in white is a little much, isn't it? With the hat and the cane? Just work on the little beard and you'll be Richard Attenborough in Jurassic Park.

#### CLIVE

Can't pretend that's not what I'm going for. And trust me you'll see some dinosaurs by the end of the day. Speaking of which, where's Malcolm?

#### REBECCA

It took more effort than I care to share to convince my father not to come.

#### CLIVE

Then why wouldn't you let him? This is everything he ever he wanted -

#### REBECCA

If I left you two together for 20 minutes, he'd sign the company away, blow his estate on one of your lap dancers until his heart exploded and he'd be in one of your second rate cryopods by morning.

#### CLIVE

But he would've had a hell of a night. Right. In we go.

##### [THEY REACH THE DOOR AND HEAD INSIDE - AS THE DOOR CLOSES A TANNOY KICKS IN]
##### [THE HANDSOME VOICE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE ALOHA ETERNITY, SEBASTIAN BEDFORD]

#### BEDFORD

Welcome aboard the Aloha Eternity. Getting a few extra stops in before life's ultimate destination.

#### REBECCA

Jesus. Tell me you didn't have that playing just for me. 

#### CLIVE

That's Sebastian Bedford himself, the founder of this great enterprise. Invented the idea while on a cruise with his family exploring the fjords of Norway in the noughties. He voices all the robots on the ship.

#### REBECCA 

How quaint. Is he dead yet?

#### CLIVE

Nah. We're picking him up in Cuba in a couple of weeks.

#### REBECCA

Good chance he is then. I hear the insurgents there are -

#### CLIVE

Ay yay yay. Leave reality where it belongs, outside. On that topic, I hope you brought something more fun to wear, the fatigues are a bit too real world, you know. The clientele pay us to escape exactly that.

#### REBECCA

So sorry.

##### [CLIVE SNAPS HIS FINGERS]

#### CLIVE

Tomas!

#### TOMAS

Yes, sir.

#### CLIVE

Tomas here will take you to your cabin. Get yourself settled in and I'll meet you in the Thirsty Burger for cocktails, right. Deck 7.

#### REBECCA

We have important things to discuss, Clive.

#### CLIVE

Ergo, cocktails. Aloha!

##### [CLIVE DEPARTS]

#### REBECCA

Tosser.

#### TOMAS

It's Tomas, Madam.

##### [A CHEESY HOUSE BAND PLAYS WHILE ELDERLY DRINKERS CHATTER AND GUFFAW]
##### [THE FORCED LAUGHTER OF YOUNG NUBILE WAITRESSES AND TABLE DANCERS ENDURING ANOTHER DAY AT THE OFFICE]

#### CLIVE

I like to sit at the bar, do you mind if we sit at the bar?

#### REBECCA

The bar is fine.

##### [CLIVE BANGS A HAND DOWN]

#### CLIVE

The bar is fine! Sophia! My love!

#### SOPHIA

_[in an Eastern European accent]_ Good afternoon, Mr Schill.

#### CLIVE

Old Fashioneds?

#### REBECCA

I'll have a gin and tonic, thank you.

#### CLIVE

Two Old Fashioneds.

#### REBECCA

_[annoyed]_ I said a gin and fucking tonic!

#### CLIVE

I know! The Old Fashioneds are for me.

#### REBECCA

Oh.

#### SOPHIA

I'll have your drinks sent over in a moment.

#### REBECCA

Sorry.

#### SOPHIA

No worries.

##### [SOPHIA DEPARTS]

#### CLIVE

Rebecca, you seem stressed.

#### REBECCA

The world's on fire, Clive, everyone is stressed. What are those?

#### CLIVE

I mean... that's just objectively not true. Sophia, you stressed?

#### SOPHIA

_[faintly]_ Too blessed to be stressed, boss!

#### REBECCA

What are you taking? Are those Eterniteze?

#### CLIVE

Yeah.

#### REBECCA

Clive, for God's sake. You take them recreationally?

#### CLIVE

Eterniteze is great for many things. Wiring your brain for hypersleep, reducing anxiety, and just taking the edge off this crummy world. Everyone here takes it. Look around you, you see stress in these people?

#### REBECCA

I see... Jesus, is that a table dancer? It's the middle of the day.

#### CLIVE

She's normally dancing on the bar, I asked her to move for
you.

#### REBECCA

That's so sweet. Clive, can we please get on with -

#### CLIVE

You came all this way. Can we just... Hakuna Matata for 5 minutes, right? Olives? Here's a Bedford Bot.

#### REBECCA

What is a Bedford Bo - ah!

##### [SHE RECOILS AS THE WHIRR OF A DRONE REACHES THEM AT THE BAR]

#### BEDFORD BOT

[in Sebastian Bedford's voice] Aloha! Would anyone like olives?

##### [WITH A HURRIED CLINK OF HER HAND ON GLASS REBECCA TAKES SOME OLIVES]

#### REBECCA

Yes. Fine. Olives. Make it go away.

#### CLIVE

Thank you, Bedford Bot.

#### BEDFORD BOT

You're so welcome! Aloha!

##### [WITHOUT FURTHER ADO THE DRONE LEAVES AND FLIES TO ANOTHER CUSTOMER]
##### [ABOVE THE HUBBUB CAN BE HEARD ANOTHER IDENTICAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF 'ALOHA!']

#### CLIVE

Like I was saying, look around you. All of these people were staring down the barrel of death. They chose to spend the time they had left having fun. They eat, drink, dance, gamble, say something inadvertently/openly racist every now and then, hump each other to sleep, then do it all again the next day -

#### REBECCA

Hump?

#### CLIVE

You know what the biggest stress of my life is? Chlamydia. The sexual health nurses are the busiest people on the ship.

#### REBECCA

Jesus wept.

#### CLIVE

Their names are Chloe and Lydia as well, you couldn't make it up.

#### REBECCA

So, how does all this work?

#### CLIVE

Ah well, you've joined us on one of the most highly sought after legs of the cruise, the South American coast. 183 guests at present. All with various ailments. Back third of the ship is entirely medical wing. We give them whatever they need to keep the party going as long as they want, along with the Eterniteze drug that makes them neurologically... pliant, ahead of the Kontinue process. When the fat lady sings, Pamela Jennings and her cryo team jump in and do the business.

#### REBECCA

How many guests do you have in cryonic storage right now?

#### CLIVE

Just four. They'll be collected and flown to the storage site in Miami when we hit five. Two of them agreed to be on public exhibition in the Bedford Hall of Eternity on Deck 4. We can go see them if you like.

#### REBECCA

I do not like. Where's that drink?

#### CLIVE

Now, that is the spirit!

##### [ANOTHER DRONE WHIRRS IN WITH THE DRINKS]

#### BEDFORD BOT

Aloha! I'm bringing drinks!

#### REBECCA

Jesus.

##### [THEY TAKE THEIR DRINKS OFF THE FLOATING TRAY WHICH THEN WHIZZES OFF]

#### REBECCA

Dancing girls, flying robots serving drinks, weird looking house band... Forget Jurassic Park, this is Jabba the Hutt's sailing barge.

#### CLIVE

And I suppose I'm Jabba.

#### REBECCA

No... there's a distressingly plump and clammy old man in the corner staring at me and licking his lips that I'm thinking about strangling with a chain actually.

#### CLIVE

Oh, oh tha - that's Melvyn. He's lovely.

#### REBECCA

I'm sure.

##### [PAUSE]

#### CLIVE

Umm… Actually Rebecca... I don't… I don’t want to hurt your feelings, but I'm not convinced that's a look of lust.

#### REBECCA

What do you -

#### CLIVE

Sophia, hey, hey. You might want to get near the big red button.

#### SOPHIA

I've already called the cryo team, Mr Schill.

#### CLIVE

Course you have. Bloody pros the lot of you.

#### REBECCA

What's going on?

#### CLIVE

Fantastic timing. Couldn't be better.

##### [THERE IS A HUBBUB AROUND THE BAR AS PEOPLE START TO NOTICE WHAT'S GOING ON]

#### OLD 1

_[excited]_ Ooh look, it must be Melvyn’s time.

#### OLD 2

I thought there was something. Go on Melvyn!

#### REBECCA

Christ, he's not -

#### CLIVE

He's having a heart attack, yeah. Everyone's got a little wristband on. If their vitals get in the red it alerts the cryo team - oh Sophia, I think… I think he's going to slump -

##### [SOPHIA RUNS OVER TO MELVYN]

#### SOPHIA

It’s ok, it’s ok, I got it, I got it.

#### OLD 3

Go on Melvyn!

#### REBECCA

We need to help the poor man!

#### CLIVE

You wanted to strangle him 30 seconds ago. Drink your drink.

##### [THE DOORS OPEN WITH A BANG AS A GROUP OF PEOPLE ENTER WITH A VARIETY OF EQUIPMENT, TROLLEYS ETC]
##### [OVER THE NEXT 30 SECONDS, GLASSES ARE PUMPED, FEET BEGIN TO STAMP, A CHANT OF MELVYN'S NAME STARTS TO BUILD]

#### CLIVE

Here they are. In the corner!

#### PAMELA

Thanks Clive!

#### REBECCA

Is that Pam?

#### CLIVE

The one and only.

#### REBECCA

Why's she wearing sunglasses indoors?

#### CLIVE

Slave to fashion.

#### OLDS

Mel-vyn! Mel-vyn! Mel-vyn!

#### REBECCA

What the hell is happening?

#### CLIVE

I wanted you to see this, I'm so glad it's happened. Icing on the cake. How we doing Dr Jennings?

#### PAMELA

Two thumbs up!

#### OLDS

Mel-vyn! Mel-vyn! Mel-vyn!

#### CLIVE

Sophia, I'm hitting the button!

#### SOPHIA

Go ahead!

#### CLIVE

It's normally your job, are you sure?

#### SOPHIA

Take it away, boss!

#### OLDS

Mel-vyn! Mel-vyn! Mel-vyn!

#### CLIVE

What am I thinking, Rebecca, do you want to hit the button? It's just on the other side of the bar there.

#### REBECCA

What's the big red button do?

#### CLIVE

Time for the fat lady to sing.

#### REBECCA

What?

#### CLIVE

You snooze you lose!

##### [CLIVE SMACKS THE BUTTON] 
##### [OVER THE TANNOY A TINNY DRUM ROLL, THEN HAPPY DEATH DAY, SUNG BY SEBASTIAN BEDFORD, PLAYS]
##### [THE WHOLE ROOM SINGS ALONG, CHEERING]

#### ALL

_[singing]_ Happy death day to you. Happy death day to you. Happy death day dear Melvin. Happy death day to you.

##### [LAUGHTER]

#### CLIVE

Ah Melvyn. He'll be gutted he missed out on Rio.

#### REBECCA

I'll take that other Old Fashioned please.

##### [CUT]

##### [THE DOOR TO A GALLERY OPENS, REBECCA'S HEELS ECHOING ON THE MARBLE FLOOR]
##### [A MOMENT LATER CLIVE'S FOOTSTEPS AND CANE FOLLOW]

#### REBECCA

_[slightly drunk]_ Holy shit, Clive. You said you had a gallery, I didn't think...

#### CLIVE

I told you, it's not all fall -of-the-Roman-Empire orgies and vomitoriums.

#### REBECCA

This is incredible.

#### CLIVE

Although there is a toga party in the bingo hall last Friday of the month that goes downhill pretty fast.

#### REBECCA

Are these originals?

#### CLIVE

In the morning, it smells like a farmer’s market, I can't even go on that deck...

#### REBECCA

Clive!

#### CLIVE

Yes, yes. It’s Bedford's private collection. He wanted to share it with the world. By which I presume he means, obscenely wealthy old white people. There's supposed to be music, now… where's the music?

##### [CLIVE GOES TO A WALL AND PRESSES BUTTONS, STARTING CLASSICAL MUSIC] 
##### [REBECCA AND CLIVE WALK IN SILENCE FOR A MOMENT]

#### REBECCA

Clive, I'm here to congratulate you on securing the Kontinue investment made by the Venezuelan government, things are looking very encouraging with the Argentinians and Columbians, and to wish you every success ahead of tomorrow’s meeting with President Macedo in Rio.

#### CLIVE

All of which you could've done via passive aggressive email. So, why are you really here, Becky?

#### REBECCA

I've had reports that Wilkins is interested in sitting down with us.

#### CLIVE

Shit, really?

#### REBECCA

Which has led to whispers that Bernard might be considering as well. Even heard rumblings from the Germans.

#### CLIVE

This is incredible!

#### REBECCA

_[unenthused]_ Yes. Very incredible.

#### CLIVE

So, why are you miserable?

#### REBECCA

Clive, I want you to consider slowing down.

#### CLIVE

Slowing down? It's taken years to get anyone in Europe to sit down with us. We crack the UK, France and Germany and everything’s on the table.

#### REBECCA

It's taken years because they were spending their money trying to turn things around. To try and stop what's happening, what's happening everywhere.

#### CLIVE

Yeah, they're real heroes.

#### REBECCA

If it's just the odd paranoid dictator wanting the latest perk for his panic room, then all well and good. But once every major government in the Western world buys a bulk pack of cryopods and starts digging a bunker it sends a message, don't you think?

#### CLIVE

_[dismissive]_ Becky, I think you sound a little alarmist and frankly a little ungrateful. Kontinue has turned things around for Overhead -

#### REBECCA

I know.

#### CLIVE

The company your father helped build, the company you stand to run not long from now.

#### REBECCA

Clive, there isn't going to be a 'not long from now', and the people are starting to figure it out.

##### [CLIVE SCOFFS]

#### CLIVE

The people? Your personal pilot landed your personal helicopter on the most expensive ocean liner on the seven seas that you part own, you want to talk about 'the people'?

#### REBECCA

I wasn't joking about Cuba. There are activists, terrorist groups. They… they know the high and mighty are planning on locking themselves away and going to sleep while the planet tears itself to bits. The raid on the Kontinue plant in Michigan last month -

#### CLIVE

You said that was handled.

#### REBECCA

It was handled. But not without significant disruption to production. They blew up a lab. People died, Clive. Our people. They should never have got as far as they did.

#### CLIVE

What-what are you saying? That it was an inside thing?

#### REBECCA

I'm… I’m saying… once this knowledge is out there, you can't put it back in the bottle. We've identified cells in at least 15 countries, environmentalist groups who are specifically targeting cryotech. I'm scared. And you should be too. Right now, we're floating on the biggest billboard in the world for the cryonics industry. You couldn't paint a bigger bullseye on your face. And from what I've heard Macedo has made no secret of his interest in your offer. I don't know what we're sailing into tomorrow.

#### CLIVE

We're sailing into Rio de Janeiro, where our guests will have a jolly old time in the sunshine and get some nice souvenirs of that big statue of Jesus, while I add a few more zeroes to our net gain this year. Do I need to remind you that we were still playing catch up 18 months ago, Amos did it ugly but they did it first, the lengths I've had to go to -

#### REBECCA

Yes yes! We all know you're the man who saved Overhead, good God! I assume all the life rafts on this boat are filled with the hot air that comes out of your mouth!

##### [PAUSE]

#### REBECCA

It's late. I've drunk too much. I'm going to bed. We can talk more tomorrow.

#### CLIVE

Tomorrow you can fly your helicopter over Sugarplum Mountain and watch the sun go down over one of the most beautiful cities in the world. All courtesy of Kontinue.

#### REBECCA

It's Sugarloaf Mountain. Enjoy your paintings.

##### [SOFTLY, IN THE DISTANCE, AN ALARM WAILS]

#### CAPTAIN

_[through a comm]_ Mr Schill? Mr Schill.

##### [CLIVE AWAKENS DROWSILY, HUNGOVER]

#### CLIVE

What? What time is it?

#### CAPTAIN

03:00, sir.

#### CLIVE

What's going on?

#### CAPTAIN

Sir, I think you better come to the bridge.

#### CLIVE

What is it?

#### CAPTAIN

We'll see you on the bridge, sir.

##### [CUT]
##### [THE ALARM WAILS AS CLIVE MAKES HIS WAY DOWN A CORRIDOR, OTHER PASSENGERS BUSTLING PAST HIM]

#### CLIVE

What is going on? Half the ship is up.

#### REBECCA

Look out the window.

#### CLIVE

What the hell is that?

#### CAPTAIN

That's the port, sir. Some kind of explosion.

#### CLIVE

Captain, how close are we to the port?

#### CAPTAIN

A kilometre.

#### CLIVE

Please stop the ship.

#### CAPTAIN

I called all stop 10 minutes ago, sir.

#### CLIVE

Oh. yeah… er. What does the radio say?

#### REBECCA

The radio is jammed.

#### CLIVE

Jammed?

#### CAPTAIN

Jammed, sir.

#### CLIVE

Who's jamming the radio?

#### REBECCA

We don't know. There's smoke coming from the city too.

#### CAPTAIN

We thought it was festivities of some kind, but now we think there may have been some kind of... incident.

#### CLIVE

Some kind of incident. Thank you so much, Russell.

#### CREW

_[in the background]_ TV's working!

#### CLIVE

Okay. Hey, oi, get those people indoors. I want them off the deck.

#### CREW

Yes, sir.

##### [THEY GATHER ROUND A TELEVISION ON THE BRIDGE]
##### [A BRAZILIAN NEWS REPORT PLAYS - A NEWSCASTER FRANTICALLY TRIES TO EXPLAIN A CHAOTIC SITUATION]
##### [SOUNDS OF A RIOT - CAR ALARMS, SHOUTING, BREAKING GLASS, FIRE]

#### CAPTAIN

Turn it up.

#### CLIVE

What are they saying?

##### [ON THE TELEVISION, AMONGST THE CHAOS, A FAMILIAR SONG CAN BE HEARD BLASTING FROM SPEAKERS IN THE STREETS]

#### CAPTAIN

_[translating]_ They’re saying… Protests on the street from yesterday turned violent in the evening... then separate explosions around the city including government buildings...

#### REBECCA

Wha… What's that noise?

#### CLIVE

It's music... metal.

#### REBECCA

Metal?

#### CLIVE

I know that song.

#### REBECCA

That's a song?

#### CLIVE

How do I know that song?

#### CAPTAIN

Hey you! What are you doing on the bridge?

#### CLIVE

Sophia?

#### SOPHIA

The song is called Morior Invictus.

#### CLIVE

What?

#### SOPHIA

It means Death Before Defeat.

#### CLIVE

What y… What are you talking about?

#### SOPHIA

The first detonation will be in the cargo hold. You should all have time to reach a life raft. The rest will be on the deck. For all to see.

#### CLIVE

What are you holding -

#### CAPTAIN

It's a trigger -

Which way?

Left! No, oth-other left!

#### REBECCA

Good?

He could be one of them!

He's good!

Only Latin I know is carpe the fucking diem, sir.

Then let's go!

Copy that!

Fucking hell. The passengers. We've just left them.

What the hell do these people want from us?

They want to sink the ship.

W-Who is that?

We want everyone to watch it burn.

#### CLIVE

Aubrey? Aubrey Wood?

#### PAMELA

How is she doing this – wher… where is she?

#### AUBREY

Far enough away to have a good view. Sorry about your boat, Clive. It was very pretty.

#### CLIVE

You… better… find… You better find somewhere good to hide you little shit, I swear to God -

You've had every chance to walk away from this. You all have. Are you sure you want to continue?
