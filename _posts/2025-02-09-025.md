##### [THE WARD. COMMOTION AS THE PATIENTS ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO THE SUBLEVEL. BEDS BEING PUSHED PAST, TROLLEYS WITH SQUEAKY WHEELS, CONVERSATIONS, RAISED VOICES. MARMITE, IN THE BACKGROUND, ARGUES WITH ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE NURSING TEAM]

#### NURSE

Marmite put the bed up before you unplug it or it won't go.

#### MARMITE

Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

#### NURSE

Then why are we having this conversation?

##### [A BED RATTLES PAST. SHE CALLS OVER TO WARREN, WHO'S LOADING A LINEN TROLLEY]

#### NURSE

You okay there, Warren?

#### WARREN

Uh, yeah!

#### NURSE

Just take what we need, you don’t need to pile up everything.

#### WARREN

Sure!

##### [HE LOWERS HIS VOICE]

#### WARREN

Cause I know what we need. For anything whatsoever.

##### [HE MOVES SHEETS FROM THE CLOSET TO HIS TROLLEY]

#### WARREN

Gord, does this happen often? Moving everyone around like this?

#### GORD

We have evacuation drills to the sub level every 4 months.

#### WARREN

The real thing though. Like, not a drill.

#### GORD

There have been 3 occasions since my activation where a risk assessment advised the precautionary measure of sub level evac.

#### WARREN

So, this isn't the first time something scary has happened. People are like ready for it.

#### GORD

Two of them were threats from other communities that were successfully averted through negotiation and trade agreement. The third was a flock of pink-footed geese that Marmite mistook for an airborne assault.

##### [THIS IS NOT COMFORTING INFORMATION]

#### WARREN

Cool cool cool.

##### [WARREN'S COMM CRACKLES. IT'S HESTER]

#### HESTER

Warren, it's Hester. How are you doing up there?

#### WARREN

Uh, fine thanks. It's all very busy.

#### HESTER

Just do what you can. You're an extra pair of hands, we're grateful.

#### WARREN

Right. Hester, there are a lot of things going on here that I don't understand, and it all feels like a lot of fuss, are you absolutely sure that this isn't all my fault?

#### HESTER

It isn't your fault.

#### WARREN

It feels like it might be my fault.

#### HESTER

With respect Warren, it isn't always about you.

#### WARREN

I... Wow, alright. Jesus.

##### [CUT TO: HESTER, WALKING DOWN A BUSY CORRIDOR. PEOPLE MOVE BY HER QUICKLY] 

#### HESTER

Sorry. I was experimenting with tough love.

#### WARREN

That's more Aubrey's area, isn't it?

##### [THE CLATTER OF ITEMS BEING DROPPED ON THE FLOOR. HESTER SHOUTS AT WHOEVER DROPPED THEM]

#### HESTER

Watch what you're doing with those! We don't have time to forge new weapons!

#### WARREN

What?

#### HESTER

Don't worry about it! Warren, once everything is in place I'll be running things from the Control room - if you'd rather join us down there than be in your quarters, you're welcome.

#### WARREN

Okay, thanks. Bye.

##### [WARREN CLICKS OFF. HESTER CLICKS THROUGH CHANNELS, AND GRUMBLES TO HERSELF]

#### HESTER

Stevie? Where are we?

##### [CUT TO: STEVIE, IN THE FARMHOUSE. IT'S QUIET, JUST THE CREAK OF A FLOORBOARD HERE AND THERE]

#### STEVIE

Hi Hester. I'm at the house. Defences are live, don't send anyone else out here now.

#### HESTER

And the valley floor defence system?

#### STEVIE

I mean, everything looks good. As long as the reactor is happy it should work fine. I'll make my way back now, does Grace need any help?

#### HESTER

I don't know if he's in the operating room or fetching our special guest.

#### STEVIE

Aye, I'll check. If he's okay, I'll see you in Control.

##### [STEVIE TURNS HER COMM TO A DIFFERENT CHANNEL]

#### STEVIE

Grace? It's Stevie. I'm done at the farmhouse, do you need a hand?

#### GRACE

No, thank you Stevie, all in hand. Head to Control.

##### [CUT TO: GRACE, WHO'S STANDING IN BRYONY HALBECH'S CELL]

#### STEVIE

Sure thing boss. Careful around the evil genius. Remember she's a good shot at throwing shoes.

#### GRACE

Thank you for the advice, Stevie.

##### [HE IS ONLY A COUPLE OF METRES AWAY FROM BRYONY]

#### BRYONY

Surely I’m not the first person to throw a shoe at her. How can you live alongside such relentless pluckiness?

#### GRACE

It's time to get to work, Bryony.

##### [BRYONY YAWNS AND STRETCHES]

#### BRYONY

Righty. So, do I get a lab, a team? What kind of timeframe are we working with? I'll need a few days to survey what kit you have in the future...

#### GRACE

The bad people might be coming to kill us all sometime over the weekend. So, we thought we'd better crack on and get it done tonight.

##### [BRYONY LAUGHS HEARTILY FOR PERHAPS THE FIRST TIME EVER]

#### BRYONY

Oh, sure. Sure! Why not. It's the weekend you say? I do hope there's music. I'm sure Aubrey runs a fun emergence.

#### GRACE

I'll be in charge of Gordon's emergence.

#### BRYONY

Oh really? And what's Aubrey up to?

#### GRACE

Everything else.

##### [CUT TO: MALCOLM'S QUARTERS. AUBREY IS ADMINISTERING SOME MEDICATION TO MALCOLM. MALCOLM IS SUBDUED BUT QUITE UPBEAT]

#### AUBREY

Hold still.

#### MALCOLM

Yes.

##### [AUBREY GIVES HIM AN INJECTION]

#### AUBREY

And there.

#### MALCOLM

You know umm... You know I can do my own injections.

#### AUBREY

I know you can. Just wanted to.
 
#### MALCOLM

How are you feeling?

#### AUBREY

I'm fine.

#### MALCOLM

So am I. Isn't that strange?

#### AUBREY

You and I are alike that way. It's the standing still that kills us. Days like this... that's when we come to life.

##### [MALCOLM GRUNTS A LAUGH AT THIS,]

#### AUBREY

You sure you're okay, Malcolm?

#### MALCOLM

Don't be soft. I'll be alright. You just do what you're best at.

#### AUBREY

Alright.

#### MALCOLM

Hold your bloody nerve, Aubrey. And maybe we both get what we want.

------

##### [THE INFIRMARY, IN THE SUBLEVEL OF THE STATION. GRACE, BRYONY, AND THE REST OF THE SURGICAL TEAM ARE STOOD AROUND GORDON'S POD. THE OTHER TEAM MEMBERS ARE MOVING AROUND THE ROOM. EQUIPMENT IS BEING WHEELED IN AND OUT, BEING PLUGGED IN, VARIOUS BEEPS AND ALARMS AS SELF-TESTS ARE CARRIED OUT. THE SWOOSHING NOISES OF A MECHANICAL ARM - THE ROBOTIC SURGICAL ASSISTANT GRACE ASKS FOR ATTENTION]

#### GRACE

Okay. Alright. Everyone's here, yes?

#### TEAM

Yes sir.

#### GRACE

Good. It's important not to look at this as two procedures, the emergence and then the surgery. They are both entirely intertwined. The moment we press go and the thawing process begins our patient goes from stable to unstable. From known to unknown. So, we want to get him out of this pod and on to the operating table as fast as possible.

##### [HE PAUSES]

#### TEAM

Yes sir.

#### GRACE

On a more personal note, I know there are a lot of nerves around this situation, and for some of us a lot of emotions. Myself included. I knew Gordon Porlock for a short time. And it was Aubrey and I who put him in this cryopod 44 years ago. So, believe me when I say I understand your apprehension. But you are in this room now because we know what you are capable of. The most important thing to remember at any stage of this operation is to communicate. If you see something you don't think looks right, speak up. I'm team leader for this procedure, but Gord operates the surgical drone, please listen to him. Okay then. Anaesthetics?

#### ANAESTHETICS

Check.

#### GRACE

ECMO?

#### ECMO

Check.

#### GRACE

Transfusion?

#### TRANSFUSION

Check.
 
#### GRACE

Resus?

#### RESUS

Check.

#### GRACE

Gord?

#### GORD

Surgical drone is fully operational.

#### GRACE

Bryony?

##### [SILENCE]

#### GRACE

Bryony?

#### BRYONY

Oh. Check. Check a doodle doo. Sorry, I was thinking about something else entirely.

#### GRACE

Are you ready?

#### BRYONY

The robot surgeon speaks with Gordon's voice.

#### GRACE

Yes. We could change it back but-

##### [RUMBLINGS OF DISSENT FROM THE TEAM]

#### ANAESTHETICS

No, we like it.

#### RESUS

It's kind of soothing.

#### GRACE

It does seem to have caught on.

#### BRYONY

What a regular and well-balanced group of people you all seem to be.

##### [PAUSE]

#### GRAC

Well then. Bryony?

#### BRYONY

Yes?

#### GRACE

Uh. You start.

#### BRYON

Oh! Of course.

##### [BRYONY LOOKS AT HER STATION, REMEMBERING WHAT TO DO NEXT]

#### BRYONY

Um. Ah. Hot frogs, jumping...wait.

##### [PAUSE]

#### GRACE

No, it's hot dog, jumping frog-

#### BRYONY

Yes, yes. Hot dogs, bag of frogs, Alber-qwer-qwoo.

##### [SHE HITS BUTTONS QUICKLY AND THE POD MAKES AN AWFUL JUDDERING NOISE]

#### BRYONY

That's me, that's me.

##### [SHE HITS ANOTHER BUTTON AND THE NOISE STOPS ABRUPTLY. THERE ARE SOME AUDIBLE TUTS]

#### ANAESTHETICS

Jesus.

#### BRYONY

Come on you lot, find the fun and the job's a game. Let's start that again.

##### [CUT TO: THE CONTROL ROOM. AUBREY, STEVIE AND MARMITE, NUMEROUS OTHER PEOPLE AT THEIR STATIONS, WATCHING AND WAITING. A LOW HUBBUB OF ACTIVITY, BUT NOT LIKE THE CRYO SUITE. EVERYONE IS STILL, SAT AND BUSY AT THEIR DESK. THE DOOR OPENS]

#### HESTER

Hey, Aubrey? You're not in the suite? They're starting.

#### AUBREY

I'm needed here in Control.

#### HESTER

You're the most experienced cryonic scientist in this hemisphere.

#### AUBREY

No, Bryony Halbech is. They've got the best people down there. I'd only complicate things. Are we dark?

#### HESTER

Aubrey you've been planning Gordon's op, you should be down there. Is that - my love, why is your shotgun up here?

##### [AUBREY LOWERS HER VOICE]

#### AUBREY

I'm exactly where I need to be and if you want to have this conversation could we save it for when we're alone?

##### [HESTER KNOWS WHEN SHE'S TALKING TO A BRICK WALL]

#### HESTER

The levels are clear, and we're powered down. We're dark. Sir.

##### [BEAT]

#### HESTER

Stevie, Marmite. Any traffic out there?

#### STEVIE

Nothing to see, nothing to hear.

#### MARMITE

You really think they're coming? Tonight?

#### HESTER

I don't think anything. Aubrey?

#### AUBREY

Who knows.

##### [THE DOOR CREAKS OPEN AGAIN]

#### WARREN

Hi, Hester. You said I could join you if -

#### HESTER

It's fine, Warren. Are you alright?

#### WARREN

Yeah. I… I just, I don't know what to do with myself.

#### HESTER

It's okay. They should have started the procedure by now. It's probably best you're not just sat in your room.

#### WARREN

Thanks. Aubrey, I thought you were part of the operation.

#### AUBREY

They've got the best team. Let's just leave them to it.

#### WARREN

Umm, yeah. Sure.

##### [ANOTHER SILENCE]

#### WARREN

So, we're all just standing in silence, yeah?

#### HESTER

Pretty much.

#### WARREN

Yeah. That's cool.

##### [CUT TO THE INFIRMARY. THE RHYTHMIC THUDDING OF THE MACHINES DOING THEIR THING]

#### GRACE

Picking up any life signs yet?

#### ANAESTHETICS

Nope.

#### RESUS

This is taking too long.

#### GRACE

This is how long it takes.

##### [SILENCE]

#### GORD

Perhaps we could practice baritones again.

#### GRACE

Gord, I don't think this is the right time for th -

#### GORD

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH -

#### GRACE

Gord. Let's just focus.

#### GORD

Of course.

##### [QUIET. THE MACHINES THUD AWAY]

#### BRYONY

Is Porlock his actual name or is it something he made up?
 
#### GRACE

I'm sorry?
 
#### BRYONY

It's an uncommon name. It's a village in Devon, isn't it?
Porlock.
 
#### GRACE

I don't know.

#### BRYONY

So, there's this poet, Samuel... what was it? Coleridge. Samuel Taylor Coleridge. He's writing a new poem. This was a long time ago. It's a real moment of inspiration for him. But then he's interrupted by some fellow from the nearby village of Porlock, who proceeds to drag him away on some tedious business, and by the time he gets back to his poem, the moment's passed. The spark is gone. The poem's ruined. Hence the literary allusion of 'A Person from Porlock'. Someone who gets in the way of inspiration at the crucial moment.

#### GRACE

That's an interesting piece of trivia, Bryony.

#### BRYONY

I only learned this fact coincidentally. Sometime after I shot Gordon here. But it's apt in a way, isn't it? We were on the verge of breaking this technology. It was all coming together. Then Gordon Porlock comes along. And Aubrey Wood. And it all turned to rubble.

#### GRACE

I don't know about that. From where I'm standing, we barely slowed you down.

##### [A BLEEP ON A MONITOR]

#### ANAESTHETICS

Trace. End-tidal CO2.

#### RESUS

Grace, there's movement in the drip. He's taking the warm fluids.

#### GRACE

Open the pod. Bryony!

#### BRYONY

Yes, Dr Melé.

##### [THE HISS AND RELEASE OF THE POD'S LOCKING CLAMPS. CUT TO THE CONTROL ROOM. ]

##### [CUT TO THE CONTROL STATION]

#### MARMITE

Something just pinged on the perimeter.

##### [AUBREY WALKS OVER TO MARMITE'S STATION]

#### AUBREY

If it's a family of pink-footed geese Marmite, I'm going to give them your bunk.

#### MARMITE

I think we got a picture.

##### [MARMITE BRINGS UP A SECURITY CAMERA SHOT WITH A FEW CLICKS. THEY LOOK AT IT]

#### AUBREY

Can you enhance it?

#### MARMITE

I... don't know how to do that.

#### AUBREY

Just zoom in on it.

##### [PAUSE]

#### AUBREY

It's not geese.

#### MARMITE

Yes!

#### AUBREY

It's a fleet of drones.

#### MARMITE

Oh.

##### [A BLIP FROM STEVIE'S MONITOR. IT REPEATS AND BEGINS TO BLIP STEADILY]

#### STEVIE

I've got them now.

#### HESTER

How many?

#### STEVIE

Eighteen...no, twenty. Twenty-five. So much for the valley floor defence system, they're too high to be in range.

#### WARREN

Twenty-five sounds like a lot.

#### AUBREY

They're small. Can't be carrying much on board.

#### HESTER

Surveillance.

#### AUBREY

They want to know what they're dealing with.

#### STEVIE

They're slowing down. They're reaching the farmhouse.

#### HESTER

They won't stay long. Nothing of interest.

##### [CUT TO THE INFIRMARY. NOISE AND MOVEMENT. A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENING AT ONCE]
 
#### ANAESTHETICS

Arterial and central lines still aren't picking up, checking the transducers.

#### GRACE

Is the tranexamic on board?

#### ANAESTHETICS

Yep, looking for a new vein though, struggling with flow.

#### GRACE

Vitals.

#### ANAESTHETICS

Never going to get oxygen saturation off his peripheries. Might never pick them up again after this long. Heart rate's 130.

#### GORD

Ready to make incision.

#### ANAESTHETICS

Still waiting on blood pressure.

#### GORD

Grace, I believe I should start.

#### GRACE

His BP will go through the floor once you open him up. We need to know what we're working with first.

##### [A BEEP]

#### ANAESTHETICS

Got it. Blood pressure's 74 systolic.

#### GORD

Risk assessment made. Making first incision.

##### [GORD MAKES AN INCISION INTO GORDON'S ABDOMEN, IMMEDIATELY PRESENTING A LOT OF BLOOD. THE SLURP OF SUCTION REMOVING IT FROM THE WOUND]

#### GORD

Large swabs. Thank you. Please ensure this excess blood is salvaged for re-transfusion.

#### TRANSFUSION

Cell salvage is going.

#### GRACE

I want two units of O-neg pushed through and platelets
ready to go.

#### TRANSFUSION

Got it.

#### GRACE

Gord?

#### GORD

Toothed forceps please. Larger. There is a shard of his iliac crest I am attempting to reach. I will need to check the nerve later. Splenectomy likely. Diathermy.

##### THE HISS OF DIATHERMY (ELECTRICALLY HEATED FORCEPS) CAUTERISING BLOOD VESSELS. THERE'S A COUGH FROM THE SMOKE IT MAKES]

#### GORD

Cauterized. Well.

#### GRACE

What?

##### [PAUSE AS GORD INVESTIGATES]

#### GORD

Perhaps you could pass this to Doctor Halbech.

##### [GORD DROPS SOMETHING SMALL AND HARD INTO A DISH]

#### ANAESTHETICS

What was that?

#### GORD

The bullet.

#### ANAESTHETICS

Oh.

#### GORD

Just returning lost property.

#### BRYONY

Wow. Spicy little robot, isn't he?

#### GORD

Find the fun and the job's a game.

#### GRACE

If we could just focus, please.

##### [CUT TO THE CONTROL ROOM. THE BLIP OF THE DRONES ON STEVIE'S SENSOR]

#### STEVIE

The drones are at the house. They're stopping.

#### WARREN

What are they doing?

#### HESTER

Looking for a heat signature. They'll move on in a second when they see it's empty.

#### WARREN

How dangerous are these things?

#### HESTER

Depends what resources Overhead have. They're small but they could still be armed. Or just here to look around.

#### STEVIE

They're circling the house.

#### MARMITE

Why would they do that? If it's empty?

#### AUBREY

Because it isn't.

#### HESTER

What?

#### AUBREY

There's someone there.

#### HESTER

Who is there?

##### [CUT TO THE FARMHOUSE. WIND IS BLOWING THROUGH THE OPEN AND FLAPPING FRONT DOOR - FLOORBOARDS ARE CREAKING. MALCOLM SITS IN THE KITCHEN] 

#### MALCOLM

Right. Hello there. Come in, come in.

##### [THE BUZZING SOUND OF FLOATING DRONES ENTERING THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR]

#### MALCOLM

Ah there's room for everyone. In you come, in you come, spread yourselves out.

##### [CUT TO THE INFIRMARY]

#### GORD

I'm unable to control this bleeding, Grace.

#### TRANSFUSION

That's 8 units.

#### ANAESTHETICS

Heart rate’s going up. 170.

#### TRANSFUSION

Everything we're putting in is just coming straight back out.

#### GRACE

Okay. Okay.

##### [GRACE BREATHES OUT SLOWLY. ALARMS AND MONITORING BLEEPS CARRY ON]

#### BRYONY

It's not the right blood.

#### ANAESTHETICS

What?

#### BRYONY

It's not the right blood.

#### GRACE

What do you mean?

#### BRYONY

O Negative isn't going to cut it for him anymore. He's lived longer with the Hartshorn infusion in his system than without it. Now it's all being flushed away, and he doesn't have the time to adapt.

#### GRACE

We don't have any more Hartshorn. There is no more Hartshorn.

#### BRYONY

Well, I could make some given the right ingredients and enough time.

#### ANAESTHETICS

Time? How much time would you like?

#### BRYONY

A week or so.

#### GRACE

Bryony, if you are not going to help, I need you to be quiet -

#### BRYONY

Dr Melé, please. I was thinking about his aftercare. Right now, it's obvious what he needs. Isn't it?

##### [CUT TO THE CONTROL ROOM]

#### HESTER

Malcolm? What the hell is Malcolm doing in the farmhouse?

#### AUBREY

It was his idea.

#### HESTER

What was his idea?

#### WARREN

Sorry, what's going on?

#### HESTER

How did you get him there?

#### AUBREY

The tunnel. He enjoyed that bit.

#### HESTER

Aubrey. Was he lucid?

#### AUBREY

Of course he was. He understands the situation as well as any of us. Better, actually. This is how he wants it to be.

#### WARREN

Wants what to be?

#### AUBREY

We wanted to send a message.

##### [THE CRACKLE OF A COMM]

#### GRACE

Hester? Hester?

#### HESTER

Grace? Is everything okay down there?

#### GRACE

I need you to get Warren down here right now. Hurry.

##### [CUT TO THE HOUSE]

#### MALCOLM

Now umm… which one of you shall I address? Umm... Can any of you things talk to me?

##### [A SPEAKER CRACKLES ON THE NEAREST DRONE. A VOICE COMES TO LIFE. REBECCA LANDRY]

#### REBECCA

...Dad?

#### MALCOLM

Rebecca. I… I hoped it would be you. It's so good to hear your voice.

#### REBECCA

Dad, I... I didn't know you were... how... what are you doing
there?

#### MALCOLM

Rebecca, I want you to listen to me. Just...Just for once.

#### REBECCA

Dad, we can... we can come and get you, we can find a way -

#### MALCOLM

Rebecca. Shh... just... Listen to me.

#### REBECCA

What?

#### MALCOLM

I... I spent too many years trying to make you want the same things as I did. I beg of you, remember that person you used to be. Before the company. Before all this. I thought we could beat any challenge this life could throw at us by simply outlasting it. But we can no more separate ourselves from this world than milk from tea. You need to leave these people be, Rebecca. They're trying to do some good in the time they have left. And there isn't a lot of time left, my daughter.

#### REBECCA

I don't understand what you're saying.

#### MALCOLM

Of course you don't. You still sound so young. Younger than you should be, I fear.

##### [CUT TO THE INFIRMARY]

#### ANAESTHETICS

Heart rate's 200. He can't keep up this tachy, He's going to crash.

##### [GORDON STARTS TO FIT ON THE TABLE, SHAKING VIOLENTLY]

#### GRACE

He's fitting. Gord.

#### GORD

Sharps away. Can someone please hold his legs?

##### [WARREN OPENS THE DOOR, STRAIGHT INTO THE CHAOS. BRYONY IS COOL AS A CUCUMBER]

#### WARREN

What's happening? What have you done to him?

#### BRYONY

Warren! I'm going to need you to pop yourself on that gurney over there and roll up your sleeve.

#### WARREN

I beg your pardon?

#### BRYONY

Chop chop.

#### WARREN

You touch me and I'll chop chop your other arm off.

#### BRYONY

Warren, Gordon's about to bleed out and die. And for a bunch of reasons none of us have the time to explain, the only blood that's going to save him is yours.
 
#### WARREN

What? Grace?

#### GRACE

We are running out of options.

#### BRYONY

This is the inexplicable reason you brought me here, isn't it? To save the caretaker? So, it’s up to you, darling. 

##### [CUT TO THE FARMHOUSE. MALCOLM STILL SITS.]

#### MALCOLM

We have outstayed our welcome, Rebecca. We have no more business here. Any of us. We have to let it go. I beg of you. Just... just let it go.

#### REBECCA

Dad, let me come and get you, you - you're not well, I can
help you -

#### MALCOLM

No, I’m not well. And I... I have finally learned there are many worse things in the world than dying. How did... how did Andrew Marvell put it? Wonderful poet. 'Constrain'd not only to endure Diseases, but what's worse, the cure; And ready oft the port to gain, Am shipwrecked into health again.'

#### REBECCA

Dad...

#### MALCOLM

Nos da, fy nghariad.

#### MARMITE

Holy shit.

#### STEVIE

I think they got the message.

#### AUBREY

Are there any left?

##### [A PAUSE. AFTER A MOMENT THERE IS A BLIP ON THE SENSOR]

#### STEVIE

Just one. Heading to us.

#### AUBREY

Okey doke. Hold the fort. Shotgun.

#### STEVIE

Yes ma'am.

##### [STEVIE HANDS AUBREY HER SHOTGUN AND SHE GIVES IT A QUICK CHECK OVER]

#### MARMITE

You want to go out there?

#### AUBREY

Won't be a moment.

#### HESTER

Aubrey. Aubrey!

#### AUBREY

Back in a jiffy.

##### [OUTSIDE THE FACILITY. THE FARMHOUSE FIRE ROARS IN THE DISTANCE, IT'S ROOF CAVING IN, GLASS SHATTERING. THE DOOR TO THE FACILITY IS KICKED OPEN. AUBREY COMES STRIDING OUT. THE BLEEPS AND WHIRRS OF THE DRONE APPROACHING]

#### AUBREY

Good evening. Hope the journey wasn't too rough.

##### [AUBREY COCKS HER SHOTGUN WHICH MAKES A NICE FUTURISTIC HUM AND FIRES IT IMMEDIATELY AT THE ONCOMING DRONE. IT WHIRRS UNHAPPILY BUT NOT YET OUT FOR THE COUNT. AUBREY PUMPS HER SHOTGUN AND FIRES AGAIN. IT SINKS TO THE GROUND SADLY. AUBREY STEPS UP TO HER DOWNED TARGET]

#### AUBREY

The stars are out. The air is still. This would've been a lovely evening. Right. What have we got here?

##### [WITH AN EFFORT SHE FLIPS OVER THE HEAVY METAL DRONE. THE SOUND OF A DAMAGED CAMERA LENS ZOOMING IN AND OUT, UNABLE TO FOCUS. A CRACKLE OF STATIC FROM IT'S DAMAGED SPEAKER. AUBREY CROUCHES DOWN TO ADDRESS THE CAMERA CLOSELY]

#### AUBREY

Are you still working little guy? Can anyone hear me?

##### [THE STATIC CLICKS AND CRACKLES A LITTLE. REBECCA LANDRY IS TRYING TO COMMUNICATE THROUGH IT, BUT HER WORDS CANNOT BE CLEARLY DISCERNED]

#### REBECCA

Wood - Wood – come on – you better - answer me – Jesus Clive can you make this fucking thing work? Wood - are you – come on - listen to me - Wood -

#### AUBREY

If you're still there, Rebecca. He wouldn't have felt any pain. It was his idea, I promise you. Your father talked about his death often, how he wanted it to be. He kept returning to two main principles. He wanted it to mean something, and he really wanted to explode.

##### [THE FIRE ROARS AWAY IN THE DISTANCE]

#### AUBREY

Now, the second one we were able to accommodate. But the first is up to you. Malcolm had the same choice that all who come to Red Valley are given. You can live and die in the manner of your choosing, as long it doesn't hurt anyone else. You have that same choice. You can all walk away now and live your lives in whichever manner seems best to you. But if you come here with plans to hurt any of my people, or take anyone from here against their will, then that choice is forfeit. Let me turn this camera around. That was a beautiful old house, I don't want it burning down for nothing. I hope you can get a good picture.

##### [SHE DRAGS THE DRONE AROUND SO IT'S FACING THE FIRE]

#### AUBREY

I want you to consider the difference between yourself and your father, Rebecca Landry. Between your people and mine. None of us are afraid to die.

##### [SHE PUMPS HER SHOTGUN AND FIRES. BEFORE THE SOUND OF THE SHOT EVEN FINISHES RINGING OUT, CUT TO THE BEEP OF A DISCONNECTED COMM CHANNEL]

##### [OVERHEAD HQ. REBECCA AND CLIVE SIT, ABSORBING WHAT'S JUST HAPPENED. THE MESSAGE REPEATS IN THE BACKGROUND]

#### BLUE SKY

Connection lost. Connection lost. Connection lost.

##### [IT IS SWITCHED OFF]

#### CLIVE

Wow. Becky...I'm… I’m sorry. Uh. That must have been pretty rough.

##### [REBECCA DOESN'T REPLY]

#### CLIVE

Malcolm Landry was, uh. You know, none of us would be here without him. You, more than, well. The rest of us. Obviously.

##### [NOTHING]

#### CLIVE

But this is... this is why it was good to send the drones and stay back here at HQ. You know, Wood's played her hand. We'll keep building support here. Make more allies, strength in numbers. I'll speak to Pam, see how she can help, and then… then, you know all of us, uh, we can see what we can, um -

#### REBECCA

Clive I'm going to need you to do something for me.

#### CLIVE

Uh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

#### REBECCA

Shut the fuck up.

##### [QUARANTINE ROOM. A LITTLE TIME HAS PASSED. THE FAMILIAR BLEEPS OF MONITORING EQUIPMENT BUT CALM AND STEADY. A TICKING CLOCK. MAYBE SOME PANPIPES. A PEACEFUL MOMENT. MOVEMENT ON A BED - SOMEONE PULLING THEIR ARM OUT OF A BLANKET, HALF ROLLING OVER ON THE MATTRESS]

#### GORDON

Ugh. Urrrrgh.

##### [FROM ACROSS THE ROOM, ANOTHER VOICE, A LITTLE GROGGY BUT CONTENT]

#### WARREN

Hey... hey... hey. Either wake up or stop grunting. Oi!

##### [GORDON IS HAVING SOME TROUBLE SPEAKING]

#### GORDON

Whu - wut – what?

##### [HE TRIES TO MOVE BUT IT HURTS]

#### WARREN

Hey hey hey hey hey. Head back down. I said wake up, not get up. You've had surgery.

#### GORDON

Sur... Surgery?! Warren? Is that you? - what's - am I? -

#### WARREN

You're okay. You're okay. You're probably fine.

#### GORDON

Probably?

#### WARREN

Well, I don't know. I'm not a doctor. Wait you remember who I am, right?

#### GORDON

What?

#### WARREN

You know who I am?

#### GORDON

Warren, just tell me everything's alright.

#### WARREN

Everything's alright. Probably.

#### GORDON

Jesus.

#### WARREN

I wanted to be honest.

#### GORDON

Forget honest, just tell me I'm going to be okay!

#### WARREN

You're fine! You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

##### [A PAUSE. GORDON IS TRYING TO LOOK AROUND]

#### GORDON

I can't... see very well.

#### WARREN

Yeah. I had that too. But don’t worry it gets better.

#### GORDON

Did you have surgery too?

#### WARREN

Oh. No.

#### GORDON

Why are you in a bed then?

#### WARREN

I gave you a blood transfusion.

#### GORDON

Why?

#### WARREN

Something to do with my special blood, and the dodgy infusion that you were given, and antibodies, I don't know. It was the only way you could survive your emergence. You're welcome.

#### GORDON

Wait. Emergence?

#### WARREN

From hypersleep. You did it man. You Kontinued!

#### GORDON

What? I was in hypersleep!

#### WARREN

I know! We both did it at the same time! How cool is that!

#### GORDON

How long for?

##### [PAUSE]

#### WARREN

Well.

#### GORDON

Warren? How long?

#### WARREN

Not crazy long. But long...ger.

#### GORDON

Wait, I can see a bit better now. Why are you smiling?

#### WARREN

I smile when things get awkward.

#### GORDON

That's my line. How long, Warren?

#### WARREN

It's 2064.

#### GORDON

Oh, come on! Just tell me!

#### WARREN

It's 2064!

#### GORDON

No, it isn't!

#### WARREN

Yes, it is!
 
#### GORDON

Warren!

#### WARREN

Gordon. It's been 44 years. It's weird. But it's true. You're gonna like it.

#### GORDON

No, come on. You're being infuriating.
 
#### WARREN

Gordon, in a minute some people will walk in with faces much older than you remember them and render this discussion moot. But there are several other reasons to believe me.

#### GORDON

Okay. And what are they?

#### WARREN

Firstly, you mess around with something called hypersleep for long enough, one day you're gonna wake up in the future. You're lucky it's only 2064. And secondly, well. I'm not gonna lie to you.

#### GORDON

Well, I'm choosing not to think about this right now.

#### WARREN

Oh totally. That's my whole philosophy. I'd write that in Latin on my forehead. You get some sleep. I need you to get yourself better.
 
#### GORDON

Why? What's your plan?

#### WARREN

It’s not a plan yet. More of an outline.

#### GORDON

Let me guess. Get the hell out of Red Valley?

#### WARREN

You read my mind.

##### [GORDON IS LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS]

#### GORDON

Are you er… You gonna be here when I wake up?

#### WARREN

That's my line.

##### [GORDON'S LAUGH TURNS INTO A SNORE]
