##### [GORDON AND WARREN ARE IN THE DISUSED MEDICAL BAY ON THE GROUND FLOOR, PLAYING REBOUNDS WITH A TENNIS BALL]
##### [WARREN IS OCCASIONALLY SHORT OF BREATH AND HAS A PERSISTENT COUGH]

#### WARREN

So, the Pus Crank Christmas medley was called Beth-mayhem?

#### GORDON

O Little Town of Bethmayhem. We did several actually.

#### WARREN

Oh yeah, what were they called?

#### GORDON

God Rest Ye Metal Gentlemen.

#### WARREN

Good.

#### GORDON

The First No-Hell.

#### WARREN

That’s very good!

#### GORDON

Good King Wencesthrash.

#### WARREN

Wencesthrash?

#### GORDON

Yeah, I mean… It's harder than you think.

##### [WARREN TAKES A MOMENT TO THINK]

#### WARREN

We Wish You A Metal Christmas.

#### GORDON

Um, no… Too easy.

##### [WARREN MISHITS THE BALL]

#### GORDON

Oh, are you alright?

#### WARREN

Yeah, Yeah, I’m fine.

#### GORDON

Two shoots to me for that!

#### WARREN

I know.

##### [GORDON HITS THE BALL, WARREN TAKES HIS TURN ENTHUSIASTICALLY]

#### WARREN (con't)

While Shepherds Rocked Their Socks By Night!

#### GORDON

Um, yeah that one’s better!

#### WARREN

The 12 Days of Crustmas.

#### GORDON:

Yes!

##### [CUT. WARREN AND GORDON PLAYING GOLDENEYE]

#### WARREN

Would you rather...do a tiny shit every hour on the hour, or spend one week a year doing all your shits in one go?

#### GORDON

Is this during sleeping hours as well?

#### WARREN

For which? The every hour one?

#### GORDON

Yeah, yeah. No. Wait. No, both of them. I mean… you couldn't shit for a full week 24/7 without sleep.

#### WARREN

You get to sleep as normal.

#### GORDON

Okay umm… Would the week be exempt from annual leave or sick pay entitlements? Does this impact the whole human race or just me personally? I'd hate to lose a week of holiday just because I - Oh! Ha ha ha ha!

#### WARREN

Oh my God! Fuck sake.

#### GORDON

That is why you don't play as Baron Samedi on Goldeneye.

#### WARREN

He's the coolest one.

#### GORDON

Yeah, but his tophat still counts as his head so he has like 3 times the surface area for me to get a headshot.

#### WARREN

Well, yeah fine, let me be Mishkin then.

#### GORDON

No, I'm always Mishkin. You have everyone else to can be.

#### WARREN

But I would like to be Mishkin.

#### GORDON

No, you only want to be Mishkin cos you can't have him. I like the shape of his head.

#### WARREN

His head is square. They all have square heads.

#### GORDON

Come on!

#### WARREN

Oh oh look look, she's waddling, Gordon, she’s waddling.

#### GORDON

Waffles! Hey!

#### WARREN

To be fair, I did think tortoises came bigger than that.

#### GORDON

She's only wee. She came out of an egg remember. She'll get bigger. Like shoebox kind of big.

#### WARREN

Do you like her?

#### GORDON

She's my daughter now. Aren't you Waffles? Aren’t yah! Ow! She pinched me! Didn't you! I can't believe they actually gave us a tortoise.

#### WARREN

Well, that is the almighty power I wield.

##### [THE COMM CRACKLES]

#### GRACE

Warren, can we see you in the lab in 5 minutes, please? Over.

#### WARREN

That's a ten four. Over.

#### GORDON

A-ok.

#### WARREN

Roger Roger.

#### GRACE

What?

#### WARREN

Yep. Give me 5 minutes.

#### GRACE

That's what I said.

#### WARREN

I mean 10 minutes.

#### GORDON

Is that...is it time to -

#### WARREN

No, it's just more scans, I think.


##### [THE COMMS GO AGAIN]

#### GRACE

Gordon, I need you to help Pamela with the saline. We need to top up the supply, there's not enough down here for another freeze and Bryony wants him in before 7 o’clock.

##### [THEY PAUSE]

#### WARREN

Yeah er… We'll be there now.

#### GORDON

Warren, you've been out less than a week.

#### WARREN

Yeah well, they must be stepping it up.

#### GORDON

Look you know you don't have to actually -

#### WARREN

I know I know. I don't have to do anything.


##### [AWKWARD SILENCE]

#### GORDON

Warren. Do you...do you like going into hypersleep?

#### WARREN

Well… I like being good at something.

#### GORDON

You're good at GoldenEye. And you don't have to risk your life every time you play it.

#### WARREN

You’re gonna be here, when I get out?

#### GORDON

Always am.

#### WARREN

Well, if you're not, I get to be Mishkin. In perpetuity.

#### [CUT]

##### [IT RAINS AS AUBREY IS IN HER VAN]
##### [SHE POURS A CUP OF TEA AND BLOWS ON IT IMPATIENTLY]
##### [A LITTLE ALARM GOES OFF – SHE PICKS UP THE COMM AND CLICKS IT SIX TIMES]
##### [CLICK, STATIC, CLICK, STATIC]
##### [EVENTUALLY THE COMM CRACKLES TO LIFE]

#### GORDON

Hello?

#### AUBREY

Hi Gordon.

#### GORDON

Aubrey?

#### AUBREY

Yes, it's still me. How are you?

#### GORDON

I am freezing.

#### AUBREY

I'm sure there's plenty of places you could go inside where they wouldn't walk in on you.

#### GORDON

I don't trust anywhere inside. I don't really trust being outside. I don't know how long I can get away with this Aubrey. I can only pretend to inspect the guttering so many times.

#### AUBREY

To be honest you shouldn't be pretending. The icicles that build up on those gutters are lethal. They're like stalactites. I remember one broke off when Ben was carrying some equipment and bumped into a wall, I swear it would've gone straight through his head if it had hit him. Maybe I shouldn't stand beneath them then.

##### [A PAUSE]

#### GORDON

Aubrey?

#### AUBREY

I'm sorry. I just...I just can't believe he's dead. Ben. I mean I can, of course I can. It's why we were so careful all this time. We knew what they would do to us if they found us. I mean, I had to assume when he went quiet on me that they'd got to him. I just… I just can't believe he's been down there in one of those bloody pods. For Bryony to play with like he's a...

#### GORDON

Teddy bear?

#### AUBREY

Alright Gordon.

#### GORDON

At least you know it's equal opportunities butchery roung here. Anyone's head can be sawn off.

#### AUBREY

Ben Thomas was a lot of things but don't forget he helped you get all the information you were searching for on Red Valley, just like me.

#### GORDON

You're right. I'm sorry. And I'm sorry about Ben Thomas. He was your friend.

#### AUBREY

Well, let's not carried away, he was a twat. How's Warren?

#### GORDON

He went back in tonight.

#### AUBREY

Again? But it's only been -

#### GORDON

Five days. He's only been out of the lab for 3. This is the 5th time he's been in.

#### AUBREY

Why's she doing that?

#### GORDON

It's madness, isn't it? Clive Schill is right. If Warren's what you said he was, when he was in your van, you said he was the most valuable commodity Overhead could ever have. Why is she putting him at such risk if he's the golden egg? Gordon, I need to know what she's doing in there. I don't know what she's doing. Not the important stuff, I could never understand it.

#### AUBREY

But you're archiving for her as she goes, right? So you have access to the data?

#### GORDON

Yeah, she makes me catalogue everything.

#### AUBREY

Gordon, I need you to get as much of that as possible on to a storage device and take it into the tunnel.

#### GORDON

What?

#### AUBREY

You can do it. Say you're...exploring. For your archiving or whatever. Head down the tunnel, go all the way to the reactor housing, leave it somewhere conspicuous.

#### GORDON

And what's going to happen to it in there?

#### AUBREY

There's another way into the tunnel. From the other side of the Ballbag.

#### GORDON

There's...other mines that were supposed to be connected to it -

#### AUBREY

So, you've seen the plans then?

#### GORDON

Yes, but...how do you know they're even built, or safe?

#### AUBREY

I've been poking around one of them. It went really far.

#### GORDON

How far?

#### AUBREY

I don't know, I got scared and came back out again.

#### GORDON

I don't know about this Aubrey.

#### AUBREY

Look it's risky enough me even being this close so we can talk over the comm. The weather won't always be able to hide me so well. You can't come out and meet me. And frankly, if we're seriously talking about getting both of you out of there one day, we need to know whether that tunnel is a viable way in and out of the station. I thought you'd jump at the chance.

#### GORDON

To go down the terrifying tunnel built from an ancient granite mine into the middle of a mountain? Yeah… Sounds thrilling.

#### AUBREY

Gordon, it's not a dungeon. Your end is fine, it's totally safe. It's wired in, there's lights, it's fine. It's a fascinating concept actually.

#### GORDON

Well, send Grand Designs down there then.

#### AUBREY

Will you do it?

#### GORDON

I'm not going down there on my own. I'll take Warren when he next comes out.

#### AUBREY

But we don't know how long that could be. It could be weeks for all we know.

#### GORDON

I doubt it. Look, I'm not confronting a genuine phobia of being crushed by a thousand tonnes of rock by myself. Have you ever seen The Descent?

#### AUBREY

No.

#### GORDON

Neither have I. For that exact reason.

#### AUBREY

Very few people get the opportunity to face a phobia as specific as that. It could be a real breakthrough for you.

#### GORDON

I don't know if I like you, Aubrey.

#### AUBREY

Or you'll go down in history as the first man crushed to death by a ballbag.

##### [WARREN AND GORDON ARE AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TUNNEL INTO THE MOUNTAIN]

#### GORDON

And you've got more batteries for your torch?

#### WARREN

Er... Yes.

#### GORDON

Did you bring snacks?

#### WARREN

Snacks?

#### GORDON

Yeah.

#### WARREN

How long do you think this tunnel is?

#### GORDON

It runs all the way into the mountain. Who knows.

#### WARREN

What's in your bag? I thought it was, like, recording equipment.

#### GORDON

It's just stuff -

#### WARREN

Is that a sleeping mat?

#### GORDON

I'm anxious about it, Warren.

#### WARREN

This was your idea. We don't have to go in. Who cares what's in there? I'll get the door.

##### [WARREN OPENS THE DOOR TO TH TUNNEL]

Oh my God, it's heavy.

#### [GRUNTS WITH THE EFFORT]

Oh my God, do you have to speak Parseltongue to open this?

#### GORDON

Let me help.

#### WARREN

I've got it.

#### GORDON

Look I can help -

#### WARREN

I said I've got it.

##### [IT FINALLY GIVES AND WARREN DRAGS IT'S HEAVY WEIGHT SO ITS FULLY OPEN]

#### GORDON

Warren. You've only been out of the lab a day, this is probably really stupid.

#### WARREN

We don't do these things because they're easy, but because they're hard.

#### GORDON

Was that JFK?

#### WARREN

Well yeah… that’s my best impression. This is this is very cool and scary, isn't it?

#### GORDON

Are you sure you're okay?

#### WARREN

I'm fine. Are you okay?

#### GORDON

Prop the door with that bin would you.

##### [CUT]

#### GORDON

Did the lights just flicker?

#### WARREN

No, it was me, just messing about with the torch. Be cool.

#### GORDON

I am cool.

#### WARREN

So. There isn't a prototype small micro -

#### GORDON

Small modular reactor.

#### WARREN

Yeah, right. So, there isn't one.

#### GORDON

No, no, it was just like the seed vault. They built everything for it but never saw it through.

#### WARREN

Or maybe it was another smoke screen to hide something else.

#### GORDON

I don't think we'd be able to get in so easily if that was the case. Overhead wouldn't just leave the door unlocked if they had a cloned Triceratops down here or something.

#### WARREN

But how else would it feed, Gordon. It needs to feed. And it only eats...archivists.

#### GORDON

Shut up.

##### [THEY WALK ON SILENTLY FOR A MOMENT]

#### WARREN

So, have you heard any more from, Aubrey?

#### GORDON

Yeah, I spoke to her the other night. While you were hypersleeping.

#### WARREN

You know you don't have to whisper down here.

#### GORDON

Considering how we got in this predicament you're very laissez-faire about being overheard.

#### WARREN

What did she say?

#### GORDON

Not a lot. She mainly wants to hear about you of course.

#### WARREN

Well, I am kind of a big deal. 

#### GORDON

I'll be honest with you, Warren. We're going down here because I'm leaving a data stick for Aubrey to pick up. She wants to see all of Bryony's work on you.  

#### WARREN

What? That is wild! 

#### GORDON

She wants to know what is happening with you so she can help. Are you angry? 

#### WARREN

Why would I be angry? That's some covert shit. I thought it was a bit mad to be coming down here for a day out when you're clearly bricking it.  

#### GORDON

I just thought. I mean it's your confidential information, you know.  

#### WARREN

I think we're a bit past that, aren't we? How is she collecting it? 

#### GORDON

Well, she says there is another exit. It must be one of the disused mining tunnels from the other side of the mountain. It's much further from her end but she's confident she can make it.  

#### WARREN

Wow. All of this going on while I'm in hypersleep. What else do you guys get up to?  

#### GORDON

Nothing really. When you're frozen and everyone else is gone it's a bit... 

#### WARREN

What? 

#### GORDON

It’s… just nice to talk to someone.  

#### WARREN

Right. I mean… I hoped the tortoise would be good for you but, I appreciate she probably doesn't talk very much. 

#### GORDON

Hey, look I trust Waffles. I still don't know if we can trust Aubrey. We don't know her. Not really. I just think we have to take the risk.  

#### WARREN

Sure. Why not. I don't think anyone knows anyone to be honest. 

##### [THEY WALK ON A LITTLE LONGER]

Would you rather have the head of a dolphin, or the tail of a dolphin? 

##### [CUT]
#### [THEY'VE REACHED THE END OF THE TUNNEL]
##### [THEIR VOICES ECHO A BIT]

#### WARREN

I think, this is it.  

#### GORDON

Yeah. Great isn't it. 

#### WARREN

I guess. It’s got a kind of Batcave feel to it.  

##### [A RUSTLE OF BISCUIT WRAPPERS]

#### GORDON

Custard cream? 

##### [WARREN TAKES ONE]

#### WARREN

So, it doesn't...do anything else. It's just this empty space. 

#### GORDON

Well, I mean… it's not empty. Look, this is where the reactor was going to go. You could deliver it on a couple of trucks, trolley it down here, assemble on site. It could run the station easily, the plan was it could actually run a whole community. That's what the pamphlet said anyway. Maybe it was all made up. 

#### WARREN

Yeah right, So, umm… where are you going to leave all my deepest, darkest secrets? 

#### GORDON

Oh yeah.

##### [GORDON PULLS OUT A BAKED BEAN TIN]

In one conspicuous tin of baked beans.

##### [GORDON PULLS OUT ONE MORE SMALL PACKAGE]

#### WARREN

Wait, is that one of our Bakewell tarts? 

#### GORDON

You said she liked Bakewell tart. 

#### WARREN

I said she gave _me_ Bakewell tart. 

#### GORDON

Do you want me to take it back? 

#### WARREN

No. Can we go? I'm cold. 

#### GORDON

Sure.

##### [CUT]
##### [THEY'RE WALKING BACK]
##### [WARREN STOPS WITH A COUGHING FIT]

#### GORDON

_[concerned]_ Are you okay? 

#### WARREN

Yep. Just hang on. 

##### [GORDON SHINES HIS TORCH DIRECTLY AT WARREN]

Hey, just get your torch out of my eyes. 

#### GORDON

You're coughing blood...

#### WARREN

_[playing it down]_ Oh. It’s just a little blood. 

#### GORDON

Warren. 

#### WARREN

Look let's get back. 

#### GORDON

Warren, we need to talk about this. While we're able to. 

#### WARREN

What do you mean? 

#### GORDON

I don't know when we'll get a chance to talk without Bryony on your shoulder while you're... well, while you’re in a good mood. 

#### WARREN

In a good mood? 

#### GORDON

You know what I mean.

#### WARREN

I don't want to do this.

#### GORDON

_You_ don't want to do this? How do you think I feel? 

#### WARREN

Yeah, you seem like you're having a really bad time. 

#### GORDON

What?

#### WARREN

Don't pretend this whole set up isn't your dream job, Gordon. 

##### [WARREN BEGINS TO WALK AWAY]

#### GORDON

Hey! I've spent the last few weeks scared out of my mind. For both of us. And all of the time I've been trying to...manage you. You're happy as Larry one minute, furious or upset the next. I've heard you scream in the night, I've heard you crying in the mornings. Do you think this is fun for me? 

#### WARREN

Plenty of material for your archive, Gordon. 

#### GORDON

I watched you run a scalpel through your own hand! And you barely flinched. I watch you over and over, you walk off to go back into that pod not knowing if you're going to come back out again and there's almost a spring in your step. It's obviously affecting you. Look… you've lost weight, you're pale as milk, you're coughing up blood. Bryony treats you worse than a lab rat. I… I just don't understand. Do you want...do you want to not make it out? Is that it? 

#### WARREN

How's your memoir coming along? 

#### GORDON

What?

#### WARREN

Your memoir, the one I found in the car on the way here. Do you remember? What was it called? 

#### GORDON

Why do you want to talk about that? 

#### WARREN

What was it called? 

#### GORDON

Warren –

#### WARREN

It was called 'You Can't Freeze a Soul - My Journey Into The Cryonic Void'. Would you care to elaborate on that choice of title? 

#### GORDON

Warren, look, I never thought successful cryonic preservation could exist, I thought it was a joke science -  

#### WARREN

I would love to hear your ruminations on the nature of my soul, Gordon. Or do you just think I don't have one. Like every other nameless convict thrown on Overhead's conveyor belt of horrors. Don't tell me you don't lean in when Bryony starts using those long words. Don't tell me, that if the chips hadn't fallen a little bit differently, I wouldn't be just another tape for you to play to a different schmuck from Accounts in that fucking car park in the rain. If there is a spring in my step when I go into the cryosuite, it's because when I get in that pod I go nowhere. I think of nothing. I simply am not. And every time I go in, I have that sliver of hope that if I do come out, the world might be a different place, and I might be a different person. It hasn't happened yet, so yeah, sometimes, I am pretty disappointed when I come round. I'm sorry if that's bummed you out a couple of times on the way for your morning slash.  

##### [SILENCE]

Yeah, I'm done, do you want to storm off or shall I? 

#### GORDON

You can go.

#### WARREN

No, no, you don't like being down here on your own. You go. 

#### GORDON

Okay.

##### [CUT]

##### [AUBREY MAKES HER WAY OUT OF HER END OF THE TUNNEL]

#### AUBREY

_[elated yet exhausted]_ Oh thank God! Daylight! Sweet overcast freezing daylight! Right, right, so -  

##### [SHE PULLS OUT HER PHONE]

That was 2 hours to get in, 1 hour 40 to get back, 17,464 steps. Jesus. 

##### [SHE DRAGS HERSELF BACK TO THE VAN, PARKED AT THE MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL]
##### [SHE GETS IN, REMOVES HER JACKET AND HAT AND COLLAPSES INTO A SEAT] 

Bloody hell. Right. It's 15:30. I have the data. I'll look at it now. 

##### [SHE PAUSES]

Actually, I'm going to have a nap. And then I'll look at it.  

##### [CUT]
##### [QUIET IN THE VAN]
##### [SUDDENLY THE COMM BURSTS TO LIFE, WAKING AUBREY WITH A START]

#### GORDON

Aubrey? Aubrey? 

#### AUBREY

Christ, what time is it... 

##### [SHE LURCHES TO TURN ON A LIGHT, KNOCKING A WATER BOTTLE OVER WITH A CLATTER]

Shit. Hello? Gordon? 

#### GORDON

You're there. 

#### AUBREY

Yes, I'm here. Sorry, I fell asleep. What time is it? 

#### GORDON

It's a little after midnight. 

#### AUBREY

Midnight?! How the hell is it...bloody hell, I was more tired than I thought. Gordon, Gordon, I did it. I've got it. I've got the data. 

#### GORDON

That's brilliant Aubrey.  

#### AUBREY

I haven't looked yet. But I'm all over it. I've had my nights sleep already apparently. But the tunnel is almost completely safe, it's a bit twisty and turny, and a bit dark and spooky, but it's there, it runs straight into the reactor room. Or cave, or whatever it is. And there was your bloody baked bean tin! I sat and ate half that Bakewell tart on the spot. Thank you, Gordon. It must've been hard. 

#### GORDON

Yeah.

#### AUBREY

Gordon, wha… what's wrong?

#### GORDON

She put him back in again. 

#### AUBREY

Oh, God.

#### GORDON

We got out of the tunnel. We'd had a falling out. I'm just trying to look out for him, Aubrey, he was coughing up blood. I should never have taken him down there, it was just because I was too bloody frightened to do it on my own... 

#### AUBREY

What happened?

#### GORDON

She was waiting for us. At the entrance. Told us off like we were kids staying out too late. I tried to protest but they acted like I wasn't even there, trying to stare each other out. And off they went. He's already in the pod.  

#### AUBREY

We're going to do this, Gordon. We're going to save him. Alright? 

#### GORDON

Alright.

#### AUBREY

We can do this. You and me. 

#### GORDON

Alright.

#### AUBREY

I mean, mainly me. But you can help.  

#### GORDON

Thanks.

#### AUBREY

Well, I'm up now. You want to play cards or something? 

##### [CUT]

##### AUBREY (FUTURE)

Stop. 

#### GORD

Would you like me to play the next entry, Aubrey? 

##### [A LONG PAUSE BEFORE AUBREY ANSWERS]

Would you like me to play the ne -  

##### AUBREY

No. 

#### GORD

Would you like to talk about your feelings?

##### AUBREY

No.

##### [ANOTHER PAUSE]

#### GORD

There's a patch coming through from Hester. 

##### AUBREY

Sure. 

#### HESTER

Hey. How you doing? 

##### AUBREY

It's after 3, why are you awake? 

#### HESTER

Do either of us really sleep any more? 

##### AUBREY

Your shift's at 7 though. 

#### HESTER

How is he? 

##### AUBREY

Warren Godby has been out for the count for the last 4 hours. I have been watching him snore for a very long time. Thank God the quarantine glass is so thick. 

#### HESTER

How'd the evening go?

##### AUBREY

The same. Still confused. I thought it wouldn't take this long for him to come round.  

#### HESTER

Hey, don't start that big brain going. We knew it was going to be a different emergence to any other. He'll be fine. It's just taking longer. 

##### AUBREY

I know. I want you to sleep, okay? 

#### HESTER

Okay.

##### AUBREY

See you in a bit.

#### HESTER

Goodnight.

##### [HESTER PATCHES OFF]

##### AUBREY

Alright, Warren. Visiting time is over. Time for cards with Gordon.  

##### [AUBREY GETS UP FROM HER CHAIR WITH SOME EFFORT AND PULLS OPEN TO THE DOOR]
##### [SHE WALKS A SHORT DISTANCE DOWN AN ECHOEY CORRIDOR TO THE CRYOSUITE] ##### [A FINGERPRINT READER BEEPS]
##### [GORD'S VOICE IS ECHOEY IN THE CORRIDOR]

#### GORD

Fingerprint verified. Wood, Aubrey Jane. Cryosuite.  

##### [THE DOOR OPENS WITH A HEAVY CLUNK]

#### AUBREY

Feels a bit much. 

#### GORD

You're responsible for setting up security, not me.  

#### AUBREY

Good point.  

##### [SHE STEPS FURTHER INTO THE ROOM – LITTLE BEEP BOOPS IN THE BACKGROUND]

This is weird. 

#### GORD

Which part? 

#### AUBREY

I haven't been in here since I changed your voice. I'm looking at Gordon in his cryopod and talking to him at the same time. 

#### GORD

You're talking to a vir 

#### AUBREY

Yes, I know. But you understand how that might be weird. 

#### GORD

I appreciate the dichotomy.

##### [AUBREY SIGHS IRRITABLY AND WALKS AROUND THE POD TO ASSESS IT]

#### AUBREY

How are his readouts doing?  

#### GORD

The self-diagnostics on Gordon's cryopod repeat every 12 hours. Nothing has been outside of acceptable parameters.  

#### AUBREY

And the generator, how's the backup?

#### GORD

Grace carried out the monthly backup generator service on the 30th with no issues. This was in last week's report. 

#### AUBREY

Yes. Thank you.

##### [PAUSE]

_[quietly]_ I know all the fuss is going on in Quarantine next door. I just don't want you to think we've forgotten about you, Gordon.  

##### [SHE PULLS A DECK OF PLAYING CARDS FROM HER POCKET]

Right. We're going to play Bastard. 

##### [GORD'S VOICE HAS REMAINED NEAR THE DOOR RATHER THAN COME CLOSER]
##### [HE RAISES HIS VOICE A LITTLE TO REACH HER]

#### GORD

Did you know that card game is also called Shithead?

#### AUBREY

Did you know that _you_ are also called Shithead?

#### GORD

Would you like me to play the next entry, Aubrey?

#### AUBREY

You know me too well.
