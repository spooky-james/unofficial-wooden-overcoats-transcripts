##### [THE SWITCH OF A TAPE PLAYER RUNNING]
##### [A CRACKLING, ANCIENT RECORDING BEGINS TO PLAY]

#### AUBREY WOOD

Aubrey Wood, log number 58. The infusions have begun in earnest now. Yogi and Pooh aren't feeling too chipper. Yogi's only been out of the medibay for 48 hours as it is, I'm confident he'll be back in again by tonight. Pooh's problems are as much down to his attitude as anything else. He ripped out his IV this morning and wouldn't eat. You'd be forgiven for thinking he doesn't want to be here. All the others seem fine, responding well. Not enough time's passed to observe any particular cause for these two reactions compared to the others. And honestly not a big enough pool to draw any worthwhile conclusions anyway. Maybe it's because we didn't give the other guys such stupid names.

[CLOSE SOUNDS OF WASHING UP]

#### KAREN

What names did the other guys get?

#### WARREN

Brown, Black, Grizzly and Polar.

#### KAREN

She's right, they are less stupid.

#### WARREN

Indeed. 

#### KAREN

How much more is there?

#### WARREN

I haven't listened to it all but not a great deal. Tape's mostly blank. Maybe they were for dictation, someone transcribes the log and then wipes the tape. Maybe they used a different tape for each log, no matter how short it was. Maybe she just lost it. 

#### KAREN

Maybe it was taken.

#### WARREN

Or maybe it was taken.

#### KAREN

This is exciting!  So, what is it, some animal testing thing? That might explain why it’s a big secret. Can't pour shampoo in a rabbit's eyes these days. 

#### WARREN

You sound sad about that.

#### KAREN

You know how brittle my hair is. I need good shampoo.

##### [WARREN LAUGHS]

#### KAREN

Have you spoken to Doug about this? Do you think he'd be okay with you following some eco-warrior who's sending what I assume is confidential material to your home address?  

#### WARREN

I haven't mentioned it yet.

#### KAREN

Because this guy Gordon told you not to?

#### WARREN

No, because it's...twenty past 7 in the morning and I'm scrubbing fish skin off a frying pan. I'll speak to him about it later. Gordon's just an old fruit. The whole company is crawling with this kind of guy, little mole men who never see daylight and want to be in the X-Files. 

#### KAREN

Do you want to be in the X-Files?

#### WARREN

Are you kidding. I'm fucking married to an X-File.

#### KAREN
Ahhhhh!

#### WARREN

Ahhhhhhhhh–

#### AUBREY WOOD

Dr Thomas wants to keep going with the dietary supplements. I'm… well, I’m less inclined to continue just because they taste so bad, none of them are enjoying it and like I said, Pooh is just refusing now, even when I gave him something he liked instead he wouldn't touch it. Dr Thomas thinks it'll help the infusion process along and I don't know, maybe it would. It shouldn't be necessary though, and if we don't stick to the regimen we laid out then how are we going to prove the infusion's efficacy. I suppose we're both coming from a place of compassion. I want to keep their spirits up and send them in with as positive a state of mind as we can. Ben wants to give them the best physiological shot possible. Bryony will decide.  

##### [TAPE PLAYER CUTS]

##### [BUSY SOUNDS OF THE LUNCH HOUR]

#### CASHIER

That's £4.20 please.

#### WARREN

€4.20? How is that, it's normally 3 something.

#### CASHIER

Vegetables are 50p per serving so that's a pound... and chips are £1 a serving so that's £3...

#### WARREN

How is that £3?

#### CASHIER

That's 2 servings of chips.

#### WARREN

That's 1 serving of chips.

#### CASHIER

And the pie is £1.20.

#### WARREN

But that's only 1 serving of chips.

#### CASHIER

It's 2, sir.

#### WARREN

How many chips quantifies a serving? Is there a specific number?

#### CASHIER

I'll take £4.

#### WARREN

What? So, the price is negotiable now? Is the chip count negotiable too?

#### CASHIER

Sir...

##### [A BUSY OFFICE]

#### WARREN

Hello.

#### JEMMA

Hi.

#### WARREN

I'm sorry... this is my desk.

#### JEMMA

Oh, Warren! Hi, I'm Jemma.

#### WARREN

Hi, hi. Um. So is something wrong with my desk or...

#### JEMMA

No, the hotdesking starts today.

#### WARREN

What hotdesking?

#### JEMMA

It was in the email... from Doug.

#### WARREN

I haven't seen that email.

#### JEMMA

Oh. Awkward! I've taken your desk!

#### WARREN

Yeah. I... don't know where to sit now. They're all taken aren't they?

##### [AWKWARD PAUSE]

#### JEMMA

Hmm... Well, I assumed you're meant to be on the road today, that's why there's nothing free.

##### [PHONE RINGS]

#### WARREN

Okay, Okay, cool, humm. It's fine, it's fine, if it's just today.

#### JEMMA

Oh no, it's every Thursday.

#### WARREN

Oh what?

#### JEMMA

It's... every Thursday. Because of Neil and Doug...

##### [PHONE RINGS LOUDLY]

#### WARREN

Sorry.

#### JEMMA

You should check the email.

#### WARREN

I will, I will... Hello?

#### GORDON

Did you listen to the tape?

#### WARREN

Gordon.

#### GORDON

No, I'm the other guy you met yesterday who put his balls on the line sending recordings of highly sensitive material to your house. 

#### WARREN

Of course, of course.

#### GORDON

Is this a bad time? You seem to have a big boy voice on. 

##### [WARREN MOVES THROUGH THE OFFICE TO AN ECHOEY STAIRWELL]

#### WARREN

No, no, now is fine.

#### GORDON

Did you listen to it?

#### WARREN

Yes, I've listened to it.

#### GORDON

And?

#### WARREN

It's really interesting, yes.

#### GORDON

Yeah.

##### [PAUSE, GORDON SIGHS]

#### GORDON

Look, I'm going to be in the car park of the north build at 7pm tonight. I've got a gold colour Vauxhall Astra. Well…it's more coppery but I like to say its gold. I call it the Golden Bullet. It doesn't go very fast.

#### WARREN

Thank you for telling me that but I don't–

#### GORDON

Meet me in the car, but I recommend you get to the end of the tape first as you obviously haven't. Then we can discuss how 'interesting' it is. 

#### WARREN

I actually have a lot of other things that I need to-  

##### [GORDON HANGS UP]

#### WARREN

Motherfu-   


-----


#### WARREN

So yeah, it's good, this guy seems to have some background on the whole thing, so...yeah. 

#### DOUG

Seens to.

#### WARREN

Yeah. He says he used to work for the Seed Vault in some capacity. I think he may have been let go to be honest, he seems quite bitter about the whole thing. 

#### DOUG

Well it would be useful to find someone who was involved with the project at a managerial level. These guys, they rename, repurpose, restaff these things all the time. If it wins them their slice of the budget, they’ll do whatever they have to to stay in business. 

#### WARREN

Yeah, of course. I will, this guy is just interesting, and I thought it would be good to get to know as much about...well you know, whatever this is, before I went in all guns blazing. 

#### DOUG

All guns blazing.

#### WARREN

Yeah.

#### DOUG

Did you speak to Clive Schill yet?

#### WARREN

Uh, no. I’ve tried him, I haven't had a response back. 

#### DOUG

 I heard he's the man of the hour in R&D. I'm sure he'd be able to help. 

#### WARREN

I'm sure he can, yep, I just want to work this guy Gordon, I like to be thorough. Don't worry. 

#### DOUG

I'm not worried, buddy. Just keep me posted, alright? And ask for help when you need it, okay? That's what I'm here for. 

#### WARREN

You got it. Oh, Doug? 

#### DOUG

Yeah?

#### WARREN

Have I lost my desk on Thursdays? 

#### DOUG

Yeah, Jemma needs it while Neil is restructuring. You saw the email? 

#### WARREN

_[lying]_ Of course, of course. I think I must’ve got the date wrong, or something. 

#### DOUG

Right.

#### WARREN

Not to worry. I'll be on the road anyway. 

#### DOUG

Okay then.

#### WARREN

Okay, I'll let you go. And Doug, thank you. Again.  

#### DOUG

Don't be soft.

#### WARREN

Sure thing. 

#### DOUG

Find the money! 

##### [THEY BOTH LAUGH]

#### AUBREY

It's 3.43am. Yogi is dead. He was back in the medibay for a few hours and we'd ceased the infusion… six, no, seven hours ago. But he arrested just after midnight. Bryony and Ben were already there, I arrived as soon as I heard the alarm. We did everything right, everything we could, but we couldn't get him back. I'm going to sleep. 

##### [CLICK]

##### [CLICK]

#### AUBREY

Dr Thomas, Dr Halbech and I all concur that Yogi died of a massive hypercoagulation event. If he had had a single embolism, maybe he would've survived the arrest and we could have...there was no way we could've stopped it happening. Yogi had no genetic disposition that would invite this kind of scenario, or he never would've made it on to the program. So, it must've been a reaction to the cryoprotectant. Yogi was on the alpha course with Pooh and Brown, so we've paused their infusions while Bryony recalibrates. This still isn't going to bump the schedule apparently. Teddy Bears Picnic goes live on Monday and I have never felt stupider using that codename than I do this morning.

#### VOICE

If I could just take the account number, I can help you with that sir. 

#### WARREN

I gave you that just now.

#### VOICE

I... don't think you did.

#### WARREN

Not you, the robot person asked me to type it in before I got put through to you. 

#### VOICE

That's your policy number, not your account number. 

#### WARREN

How is that different?

#### VOICE

Your policy number is for your individual policy, the account refers to your department, Accounts. 

#### WARREN

You want a number for the account for Accounts? 

#### VOICE

Yes.

#### WARREN

Look, I don't have that number, I just have the letter you sent which tells me you're lowering my pension contribution when I requested that I increase it. 

#### VOICE

Yes, and with the account number I can access all your policy information and see where we are with-  

#### WARREN

If you need the account number to see my policy information then what is the point of a policy number?  

#### VOICE

Sir...

##### [CANTEEN CHATTER]

#### WARREN

Just the curry and the yoghurt thanks.

#### CASHIER

Could you lift the poppadom please?

#### WARREN

Sorry?

#### CASHIER

Can I see under the poppadom?

#### WARREN

What do you think is under the poppadom?

#### CASHIER

I'd like to check, please.

#### WARREN

It's curry. There's curry under the poppadom. 

#### CASHIER

Will you just lift it?

#### WARREN

No. I'm going to draw the line. I'm not going to lift the poppadom. 

#### CASHIER

Sir, there's… umm… there’s a line. I can't charge until I've seen your items and I need to confirm what is underneath the poppadom. 

#### WARREN

There are 5 chips under the poppadom. 

#### CASHIER

I'm sorry, I couldn't quite hear that? 

#### WARREN

There are 5 chips under the poppadom. 

##### [THERE IS SOME QUIET GIGGLING AND A GASP]

#### CASHIER

Well that's another pound isn't it.  

#### WARREN

It sure is.

##### [CHANGE CLINKS ON THE COUNTER]

#### CASHIER

Thank you.

#### WARREN

No, thank *you*.

#### CASHIER

Have a great day.

#### WARREN

No, *you* have a great day.

#### CASHIER

I will try.

#### WARREN

Swell. Namaste.

##### [PHONE CALL]

#### CLIVE

No no no no no, if you want to talk about anything like crop storage, anything in the Agric sector, you need to go back to before Overhead acquired all those patents. You need to go back to Wheelhouse. 

#### WARREN

Wheelhouse?

#### CLIVE

Wheelhouse. That was the company that owned all the farming contracts. They had satellite operations around the country, around the world. When we absorbed Wheelhouse we took all those over. 

#### WARREN

Right.

#### CLIVE

Overhead doesn't just buy patents, man. We buy every other company that buys patents. We own ideas, that’s the point. 

#### WARREN

Yeah, yeah, I get it. 

#### CLIVE

Yeah, you do! Doug told me you were the next big thing. 

#### WARREN

I er… I don't know about that. Clive...Do you know anything about … cryonic storage? 

#### CLIVE

Hmm. You mean cryogenics? 

#### WARREN

No, that's actually the study of...I can't remember, actually. Anything cryo-ey really. 

#### CLIVE

We own a bunch of patents for, like, athletic treatments, like cryosaunas for rich footballers, Olympians and shit like that, I don't know. What's that got to do with your seed vault thing? 

#### WARREN

Well if it was a vault for storing crops, they'd have to be frozen, wouldn't they.  

#### CLIVE

Oh right. Yeah, that makes sense. 

#### WARREN

So, you don't?

#### CLIVE

Don't what?

#### WARREN

Know anyone, any teams that work in cryo stuff?  

##### [MUFFLED SOUNDS ON THE LINE]

#### WARREN

Clive? 

#### CLIVE

Yeah?

#### WARREN

Everything alright?

#### CLIVE

Yeah man. Look I've got to bounce, good talking with you. Doug was right, you're the next big thing! Let's get a drink or something soon. 

#### WARREN

Oh, yeah, cool–

#### CLIVE

I'll email you. Peace.

#### WARREN

Ok.

##### [GORDON'S CAR. RAINFALL OUTSIDE. DOOR OPENS, THE RAIN LOUDER, SPLASHING IN PUDDLES NEARBY. WARREN GETS IN, SHUTS THE DOOR]

#### GORDON

Are you recording?

#### WARREN

Jesus, I just got in. Aren't you recording this anyway? 

##### [WARREN RUMMAGES IN BAG]

#### GORDON

Of course I am. But you need a copy for your own records. 

#### WARREN

Can't I just have a copy of yours? 

#### GORDON

Now you're being ridiculous. 

##### [WARREN PLACES HIS TAPE PLAYER ON THE DASH AND CLICKS IT ON]

#### WARREN

There. Done. Continue. 

#### GORDON

How did you enjoy the tape? 

#### WARREN

Some horrible things happening to some things with code names that are all bears for some reason.  

#### GORDON

Some... things.

#### WARREN

So, you're saying they're people, Yogi and Pooh and Brown Bear and whoever. 

#### GORDON

Well if they were bears, they wouldn't be very good code names. 

#### WARREN

I guess not.

#### GORDON

Kind of weird though isn't it. Wood talking about compassion, about doing what's right. But she doesn't treat them like people. They might as well be animals. Pumping them up with their synthetic shit and sending them to their doom. 

#### WARREN

What are these infusions, what's she giving them?

#### GORDON

I don't know exactly. But we're past the nutritional boosting phase, the training, the fitness, the aptitude tests, the gene studies. We're getting to the real ham of this sandwich, Warren. These are cryoprotectant infusions. 

#### WARREN

But what is that?

#### GORDON

Getting your subjects in the best shape of their lives is only the first part. You want someone to survive the greatest endurance test humankind has ever known, you're going to want to make sure they're ripped like Jesus before they go through it. But none of that matters if you freeze them so fucking hard ice crystals form all over their body and they end up shredded in the more traditional sense of the word. Then you'll basically just be defrosting a big red slush puppy. So, you gradually swap out their regular blood for a synthetic, that doesn't just do all your regular blood jobs but is also crammed with lots of goodies derived from all kinds of crazy shit. 

#### WARREN

Crazy shit infusions?

#### GORDON

Look, I wasn't there and I'm not a cryo...ologist. But the company's been trying to develop and refine life-extending drugs for years. If you want to follow the money, there is an R&D black fucking hole in this company when it comes to human longevity projects. They're taking DNA from amphibians, those little frogs who get frozen in lakes all winter and survive to see the spring, coldclimate insects, there's the, uh, rotten egg gas, uh-  

#### WARREN

What?

#### GORDON

Hydrogen sulphide, they used that as a fucking chemical weapon in WW1, terrifically dangerous, but apparently, it’s loaded with all this crap that protects your arteries and whatever. The stuff in red wine that’s meant to be good for you, fucking olive oil, who knows. Anyway, they fill their boys, Yogi and BooBoo and whoever, with bags of this stuff, teddy bears fucking picnic indeed, so they're as ready as they'll ever be when they go in the freezer. That's why they're all named after bears, man. They're going into hibernation.  

##### [PAUSE]
##### [RAINFALL]

#### WARREN

So, I have a lot of questions. 

#### GORDON

Are they all about accounting? 

#### WARREN

Not exclusively-  

#### GORDON

Come on, man! I am talking to you about illegal experimentation into human cryonic preservation! If I could show you the receipts I would but this is what I have. 

#### WARREN

You have to concede that what this is, is two men sat in the rain in a 1998 Vauxhall Astra. 

#### GORDON

I get it, ok, I get it. You need more. I'm doing this as gradually as I can because if I showed you the whole jigsaw your head would pop off your skinny fucking shoulders. Here is your next puzzle piece. 

##### [GLOVE BOX OPENS AND CLOSES]

#### WARREN

Another tape.

#### GORDON

Another tape.

#### WARREN

This one’s not going to fit in my Dictaphone. 

#### GORDON

No, it won't Mr Godby, but luckily you're sitting in a 1998 Vauxhall Astra. What it lacks in air conditioning it makes up for in a top-notch cassette player. 

##### [GORDON PUTS THE TAPE IN THE PLAYER AND IT BURSTS TO LIFE]
