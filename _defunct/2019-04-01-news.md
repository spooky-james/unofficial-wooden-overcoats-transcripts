# Major Site Update News!

_2019-04-01_

Hello! For... several reasons, it seems like the Archive Archive A has been getting a lot more traffic lately. As such, I've finally gotten it together enough to make a few much-needed updates and bugfixes to improve the user experience.

## Major Updates:

* Added color-coding to character dialog to make it easier to read!

* Added an extra "A" to the title.

## Bugfixes:

* __Episode 119 ("Stranger and Stranger")__ has been updated to reflect Nikola & Co's mid-episode full-length performance of the opera *Snegurochka: The Snow Maiden.*

* __Corrected various typos and transcription errors.__

* __Gertrude__ is now a __funny talking elephant__ (not reflected in dialog, only affects metadata).

* __Peter__ is now __aware that he is a character in a horror podcast__ (reflected in dialog).

* <del>__Elias__ is __made of cloth__ and has a __smooth white featureless globe for a head__.</del> This has always been the case. 

* __The Admiral__ is now __softer and fluffier__.
